# Agent-Centric IDE Decisions

(To be populated during analysis.)

## Proposed Topics

- "Agent-centric IDE" vs "orchestration shell" vs "loop runner"
- How much to lean on Inngest comparison (event-driven vs loop-driven)
- Codegen priority: what to add next (env manifest, command policy, descriptors)
