# Agent-Centric IDE Analysis Loop

Product positioning and workflow design: Repo Studio as an IDE centered on coding agents.

## Goal

Clarify how Repo Studio differs from a traditional IDE: agents handle code, story, and "art"; humans handle high-level choices, review, settings. Codegen as much as possible. "Like Inngest for loops"—orchestrate agent workflows.

## Relationship

- Repo Studio PRD and phases
- forge-loop lifecycle
- Inngest, Windmill: workflow orchestration parallels
- Informs: who does what, UX priorities, codegen scope
