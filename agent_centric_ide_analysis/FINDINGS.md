# Agent-Centric IDE Findings

## Inngest

- Event → function invocation; retries; fan-out
- Developer defines functions; Inngest runs them
- Repo Studio: human/agent defines plan; forge-loop runs steps; assistant participates

## Cursor / Codex

- IDE with embedded agent; diff UI for proposals
- Repo Studio: separate app; proposals in Review Queue
- Shared: human reviews agent output before apply

## Windmill / Modal

- Workflow builders; scripts as steps
- Repo Studio: planning artifacts; commands; story/code as domain

(To be expanded with research.)
