# Agent-Centric IDE Gaps

| Gap | Current | Target |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Positioning clarity | Repo Studio does many things | Clear "agent-centric IDE" pitch |
| Role boundaries | Implicit | Documented human vs agent vs codegen |
| Loop orchestration narrative | Planning + Commands + Loop | "Inngest for loops" framing |
| Codegen scope | Settings, OpenAPI, Payload, showcase | Broader: env manifest, command policy, descriptors |

## Feeds Into

- PRD messaging
- Phase prioritization (agent workflows first)
- UX: what to optimize for (review flow, proposal cards)
