# Docs Codegen Decisions

(To be populated during analysis.)

## Proposed Topics

- TypeDoc vs Docusaurus for API extraction
- Single pipeline (Fumadocs + generated) vs dual (Fumadocs + separate TypeDoc site)
- Settings-style descriptors: which domains (components, env, panels)
- Showcase: keep manual catalog vs derive from build-showcase-registry output
