# Code organization

## Layout

- **apps/studio/app/** - Routes, layout, globals.css.
- **apps/studio/components/** - App and domain components. `apps/studio/components/workspaces/ForgeWorkspace.tsx` is the primary workspace.
- **apps/studio/lib/** - Store, CopilotKit actions, utils, OpenRouter config. `apps/studio/lib/domains/video` is a UI showcase only.
- **apps/studio/payload/** - Payload CMS collections (users, projects, forge-graphs, video-docs, settings-overrides, agent-sessions).
- **packages/shared/** - Shared app/workspace UI and styles. No app routes or domain imports.
- **packages/agent-engine/** - Workflow runtime (steps + events + SSE).
- **packages/dev-kit/** - Meta-package that re-exports forge foundation packages.
- **packages/domain-forge/** - Forge domain logic (types, store, operations, copilot wiring).
- **packages/types/** - Generated Payload types + domain aliases.

## Atomic design map

- **Atoms**: `packages/ui/src/components/ui/*` (shadcn primitives).
- **Molecules**: composable widgets (e.g. `apps/studio/components/settings/*`, `apps/studio/components/model-switcher/*`, `packages/shared/src/shared/components/workspace/*` controls).
- **Organisms**: workspace shells and larger assemblies (e.g. `apps/studio/components/workspaces/*`, `apps/studio/components/AppShell.tsx`).
- **Templates**: `apps/studio/app/*` layout and route composition.

## Workspace + CopilotKit

- **Shell** - `packages/shared/src/shared/components/workspace/`: declarative slots, shadcn-based primitives.
- **Forge workspace** - `apps/studio/components/workspaces/ForgeWorkspace.tsx`: composes shell, registers context and actions from `packages/domain-forge/src/copilot`.
- **Editor** - `apps/studio/components/GraphEditor.tsx`: React Flow surface; mutations go through operations used by Copilot actions.

So: **context** (readable) describes the graph; **actions** (createNode, updateNode, deleteNode, createEdge, getGraph) perform edits.

## Adding a new workspace

1. Add a workspace component that uses `WorkspaceShell` + slots.
2. Register `useCopilotReadable` with that workspace's context.
3. Register `useCopilotAction` with domain-specific actions.
4. Put the editor in `WorkspaceLayoutGrid` `main` and declare overlays in one place.
