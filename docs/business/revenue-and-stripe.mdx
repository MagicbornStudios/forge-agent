# Revenue and Stripe

Revenue model and payment implementation for the platform. Technical decisions live in [agent-artifacts/core/decisions.md](../agent-artifacts/core/decisions.md).

---

## Revenue model

**Both platform and creator get paid** (Unity Asset Store / Bandlab style).

- Creators list projects, templates, or Strategy cores in the catalog. **Listing creation is free**—creators do not pay to upload a listing.
- **Buyers** pay the price the creator sets to clone. Payment goes to the creator (via Stripe Connect); the platform takes an application fee (take rate TBD).
- Catalog supports users and orgs. Pro plan gates who can list (PLATFORM_LIST) and who can clone paid items (PLATFORM_MONETIZE) as needed.

---

## Stripe Connect (day one)

We use **Stripe Connect from day one** for clone purchases so creators receive payment directly.

- Creators must complete **Connect onboarding** (Express or Standard) before they can receive payouts. We store the connected account id on the **users** collection (`stripeConnectAccountId`). Create-account API: `POST /api/stripe/connect/create-account` (idempotent; returns existing or creates Express account and saves id).
- When a buyer pays to clone a listing, the payment is created with the **listing creator's connected account**; we pass an **application_fee_amount** so the platform keeps a cut.
- Payouts to creators are handled by Stripe (Connect); we do not manually transfer. See task breakdown for Connect onboarding API and UI.

**Platform Stripe account:** The platform's own Stripe account id is in env as `STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID` (e.g. `acct_1Lp1yRHb5azKYmYy`) for reference and Stripe Dashboard parity. Code uses the secret key for API calls; the account id is for docs and support.

**Platform requirements (Connect and product):** Stripe Connect and app stores typically require customer support (email + URL), privacy policy URL, terms of service URL, and business address (update in Stripe when final). These can live in env (e.g. `STRIPE_SUPPORT_EMAIL`, `STRIPE_SUPPORT_URL`, `PRIVACY_POLICY_URL`, `TERMS_OF_SERVICE_URL`) or app settings. See [apps/studio/.env.example](../../apps/studio/.env.example) for placeholders; fill when legal and support are in place.

## Checkout and invoicing (Stripe defaults)

We use **Stripe for everything we need**—no custom payment forms.

- **One-time clone purchase:** Stripe **hosted Checkout** (mode `payment`). Same pattern as Cursor and similar products: create a Checkout session, redirect the user to Stripe, handle success/cancel URLs. Session metadata includes `listingId` and `buyerId` for the webhook.
- **Pro subscription:** Already implemented. [How-to 12 – Marketing Stripe](../how-to/12-marketing-stripe.mdx) documents the existing flow (Create Checkout Session for subscription, webhook sets user.plan to pro).
- **Invoicing:** Use Stripe for invoicing where needed (e.g. future B2B or custom billing). No custom invoicing UI; rely on Stripe.

---

## Application fee (take rate)

The platform take rate (application fee as a percentage or fixed amount) is TBD. Document the chosen percentage or formula in this doc and in [decisions.md](../agent-artifacts/core/decisions.md) when set.

---

## Revenue and payout tracking

We store per-license **amount and platform fee** (optional fields `amountCents` and `platformFeeCents` on the `licenses` collection). The webhook sets these from the Stripe Checkout session (and expanded PaymentIntent) when a clone purchase completes. **Creators** can see totals via `GET /api/me/revenue` (total earnings, platform fees, and per-license breakdown); a future account or Studio UI can consume this for an "Earnings" page. **Platform** can aggregate from licenses (e.g. Payload admin or an internal report). This is tracking only—Stripe Connect still performs the actual payouts; we do not change who gets paid.

---

## Payouts: single seller now; splits later

**Single seller per listing for now.** Payment goes to the listing creator's Connect account; platform takes an application fee. No split payouts.

Splits between multiple sellers (music-industry style) and IP/licensing (e.g. Beatstars-style) are to be figured out later when we have more features and creatable content that could justify splits. See [decisions.md](../agent-artifacts/core/decisions.md) for backlog.

---

## Developer program payouts (split while official)

**Approved editors** in the **official Studio suite** (curated third-party editors) receive a **revenue split** (e.g. share of clone revenue or platform revenue where their editor is used—formula TBD). The split is paid **until the editor is removed** from the official suite; there is **no usage-based pay in Studio**. Developers must be able to **publish updates** to their editor (process TBD). See [Developer program and editor ecosystem](developer-program-and-editors.mdx) for approved vs community apps, submission, and publish-updates.

**Rationale:** Split aligns developer reward with platform/clone revenue; continuing while the editor is official keeps incentives clear. Formula and process TBD; document in this doc and in [decisions.md](../agent-artifacts/core/decisions.md) when defined.
