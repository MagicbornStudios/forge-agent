# Revenue and Stripe

Revenue model and payment implementation for the platform. Technical decisions live in [agent-artifacts/core/decisions.md](../agent-artifacts/core/decisions.md).

---

## Revenue model

**Both platform and creator get paid** (Unity Asset Store / Bandlab style).

- Creators list projects, templates, or Strategy cores in the catalog. **Listing creation is free**—creators do not pay to upload a listing.
- **Buyers** pay the price the creator sets to clone. Payment goes to the creator (via Stripe Connect); the platform takes an application fee (take rate TBD).
- Catalog supports users and orgs. Pro plan gates who can list (PLATFORM_LIST) and who can clone paid items (PLATFORM_MONETIZE) as needed.

---

## Stripe Connect (day one)

We use **Stripe Connect from day one** for clone purchases so creators receive payment directly.

- Creators must complete **Connect onboarding** (Express or Standard) before they can receive payouts. We store the connected account id (e.g. on users or a creator-accounts collection).
- When a buyer pays to clone a listing, the payment is created with the **listing creator's connected account**; we pass an **application_fee_amount** so the platform keeps a cut.
- Payouts to creators are handled by Stripe (Connect); we do not manually transfer. See task breakdown for Connect onboarding API and UI.

## Checkout and invoicing (Stripe defaults)

We use **Stripe for everything we need**—no custom payment forms.

- **One-time clone purchase:** Stripe **hosted Checkout** (mode `payment`). Same pattern as Cursor and similar products: create a Checkout session, redirect the user to Stripe, handle success/cancel URLs. Session metadata includes `listingId` and `buyerId` for the webhook.
- **Pro subscription:** Already implemented. [How-to 12 – Marketing Stripe](../how-to/12-marketing-stripe.mdx) documents the existing flow (Create Checkout Session for subscription, webhook sets user.plan to pro).
- **Invoicing:** Use Stripe for invoicing where needed (e.g. future B2B or custom billing). No custom invoicing UI; rely on Stripe.

## Application fee (take rate)

The platform take rate (application fee as a percentage or fixed amount) is TBD. Document the chosen percentage or formula in this doc and in [decisions.md](../agent-artifacts/core/decisions.md) when set.
