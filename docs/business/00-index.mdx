## Summary

- **First revenue** = paid clone: buyers pay the price the creator sets to clone a project (or template, or Strategy core). Listing creation is free.
- **Stripe Connect from day one** so creators get paid directly; platform takes a cut. We use Stripe hosted Checkout and Stripe for invoicing—no custom payment forms.
- **Clone** = full project copy (settings, characters, graphs, pages, etc.) with media as references until the clone owner replaces them. A **license** record enables "clone again."
- **Developer program** (after MVP): developers can submit editors/apps (web tech, dev kit); approved editors receive usage-based payouts; community apps are listable and installable without payouts. See [Developer program and editor ecosystem](developer-program-and-editors.mdx).
