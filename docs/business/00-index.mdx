## Summary

- **First revenue** = paid clone: buyers pay the price the creator sets to clone a project (or template, or Strategy core). Listing creation is free.
- **Stripe Connect from day one** so creators get paid directly; platform takes a cut. We use Stripe hosted Checkout and Stripe invoicing defaults; no custom card UI.
- **Clone** = full project copy (settings, characters, graphs, pages, etc.) with media references until the clone owner replaces them. A **license** record enables clone-again.
- **Organization context is first-class** for creator data, payouts, and dashboard reporting.
- **AI usage visibility is billing-grade** through persisted `ai-usage-events` records; PostHog remains analytics-only.
- **Developer program** (after MVP): developers can submit editors/apps (web tech, dev kit); approved editors receive a revenue split while in the official suite; community apps are listable and installable without payouts.
