# Listings and clones

Business rules for catalog listings and clone-to-account. Technical implementation (Payload collections, clone API, media references) is in [agent-artifacts/core/decisions.md](../agent-artifacts/core/decisions.md) and the platform monetization [task breakdown](../agent-artifacts/core/task-breakdown-platform-monetization.md).

## Listing creation (free)

- **Creators do not pay** to upload a listing. Listing creation is free.
- Only **buyers** pay—the price the creator sets for others to clone the project (or template, or Strategy core) at that version.

---

## Clone versioning (creator choice per listing)

The **listing creator** decides per listing how "clone again" works:

- **Indefinite clones:** The purchaser can always clone (e.g. when they hit "clone again," they get the **current** version of the project). Good for "always up to date" offerings.
- **That version only:** The purchaser gets only the snapshot at purchase time. "Clone again" returns the **same** snapshot. Good for fixed releases.

This is a listing-level setting (e.g. `cloneMode: 'indefinite' | 'version-only'`) in the listing schema and Create/Edit listing UI.

## Clone scope (what we copy)

When we clone a project to the buyer's account, we copy **everything** linked to that project:

- Project row (title, slug, settings, etc.) with a new slug/name to avoid collisions.
- **Forge-graphs** (dialogue/storylet) for that project.
- **Characters** and **relationships** for that project.
- **Pages** and **blocks** (Writer) for that project.
- **Project settings** and any other project-linked data.

**Media (images, audio, etc.):** We do **not** duplicate media files. We copy **references** to the source project's media. The cloned project points at the same media files. When the **clone owner** later replaces or deletes (e.g. in Character: upload a new avatar, or remove an image), we upload the new media to our system and drop the reference to the old media. Until then, media is shared; after a change, the clone has its own media for that asset. This keeps storage and clone cost low while giving the new owner full control once they edit.

## License record and clone again

- When a user pays to clone, we create a **license** record (e.g. Payload collection `licenses`: user, listing, Stripe session/payment id, grantedAt, optional version/snapshot for version-only mode). "License" is the right term for future use (e.g. generated audio may also be licensed).
- The license enables **clone again:** the purchaser can create another copy of the project (or the same snapshot, per listing's clone mode) without paying again. UI in Studio or account lists "your licenses" and offers a "Clone again" button.

## Flow summary

1. Buyer sees a listing on the catalog (marketing site or Studio).
2. Buyer clicks "Get" (must be signed in). We create a Stripe Checkout session (Connect: payment to creator, platform fee).
3. Buyer pays on Stripe; Stripe redirects to our success URL and sends a webhook.
4. Webhook: create license, run clone-to-account (first clone), then show success page with "Open in Studio" / "Clone again."
5. Later: buyer can use "Clone again" from their licenses (respects listing's indefinite vs version-only).
