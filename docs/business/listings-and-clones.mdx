# Listings and clones

Business rules for catalog listings and clone-to-account. Technical implementation details (Payload collections, clone APIs, webhook behavior, media references) are in [agent-artifacts/core/decisions.md](../agent-artifacts/core/decisions.md) and the platform monetization task breakdown.

---

## Listing creation (free)

- **Creators do not pay** to create listings.
- Buyers pay the creator-set price to clone a listing (project/template/core).
- Listings are owned in org context where applicable (`listings.organization`) for creator operations and payouts.

---

## Clone mode (creator choice per listing)

Creator chooses how clone-again behaves via listing `cloneMode`:

- `indefinite`: clone-again can pull current listing project state.
- `version-only`: clone-again reuses the purchased snapshot/version boundary.

This is a listing-level setting in listing create/edit flows.

---

## Catalog UX fields

- Optional `playUrl` on listings allows "Play" CTA when present.
- Catalog/detail UI shows clone mode and play availability.
- Dashboard listing/game management uses org-scoped creator endpoints:
  - `GET /api/me/listings`
  - `GET /api/me/projects`

---

## Clone scope (what is copied)

Cloning to buyer account copies project-linked authoring data:

- project row (new slug/name as needed)
- forge graphs
- characters + relationships
- pages + blocks
- project settings and linked project domain data

**Media files:** clone preserves references first. If clone owner replaces/removes an asset later, new owned media is uploaded and old reference can be dropped for that asset.

**Org attribution and storage:** cloned projects are assigned to the buyer's active organization, and clone growth is blocked when org storage limits are exceeded.

---

## License semantics

- Paid clone checkout creates a **license** record at settlement.
- License enables clone-again according to clone mode.
- License records carry financial attribution fields used in creator/platform reporting.

---

## Free vs paid clone path

1. Buyer opens catalog listing.
2. If unauthenticated, "Get/Clone" redirects to login with return URL.
3. If listing is free (`price=0`), platform calls `POST /api/catalog/:id/clone` (no Stripe).
4. If listing is paid (`price>0`), platform creates Stripe Checkout session and redirects to Stripe.
5. On paid success webhook: create/update license and complete clone flow.

---

## Platform route expectations

- Buyer discovery: `/catalog`, `/catalog/[slug]`
- Creator management: `/dashboard/listings`, `/dashboard/games`, `/dashboard/licenses`
- Compatibility: `/account/*` redirects to `/dashboard/*`
