# Roadmap index

We maintain roadmaps in this folder. Use them to see what's next and how work is scoped. **Production target:** 2/14.

| Roadmap / doc | Purpose |
|---------------|----------|
| [Product](product.mdx) | Active editors (Dialogue, Character, Video, Strategy), platform initiatives (MCP Apps, Yarn Spinner), planned editors. **Update this for "what's next."** |
| [Product: MVP and first revenue](../product/mvp-and-revenue.mdx) | First revenue (paid clone/download), MVP hero moments, audience, positioning, evolution. Align roadmap and STATUS with this. |
| [Business index](../business/00-index.mdx) | Platform business verticals, monetization rules, and revenue/payout boundaries. Use with Product roadmap for direction checks. |
| [Technical / tech debt](../agent-artifacts/core/technical-debt-roadmap.md) | Technical debt, refactors, and production-readiness. For "what's next for technical debt," read this artifact. |
| [Potential ideas](potential-ideas.md) | Ideas under consideration (not committed). Triage or add ideas; when accepted, promote to STATUS, task registry, or backlog. |

The product roadmap is the main source for product/editor sequencing; the business index is the source for monetization and vertical strategy; the technical-debt roadmap is the source for engineering debt and hardening.

Main docs index: [00-docs-index.mdx](../00-docs-index.mdx). Current state and Ralph Wiggum loop: [agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md](../agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md).
