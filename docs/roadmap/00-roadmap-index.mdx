# Roadmap index

We maintain roadmaps in this folder. Use them to see what's next and how work is scoped.

| Roadmap | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [Product](product.mdx) | What we want to build: modes (Dialogue, Writer, Strategy), major features. **Update this for "what's next."** |

Optionally we add a **technical** or **architecture** roadmap for infra/architecture items; the product roadmap is the main one for product and mode plans.

Main docs index: [00-docs-index.mdx](../00-docs-index.mdx). Current state and Ralph Wiggum loop: [agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md](../agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md).
