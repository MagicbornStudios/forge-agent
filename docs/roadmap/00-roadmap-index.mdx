# Roadmap index

We maintain roadmaps in this folder. Use them to see what's next and how work is scoped. **Production target:** 2/14.

| Roadmap / doc | Purpose |
|---------------|----------|
| [Product](product.mdx) | Active editors (Dialogue, Character, Video, Strategy), platform initiatives (MCP Apps, Yarn Spinner), planned editors. **Update this for "what's next."** |
| [Product: MVP and first revenue](../product/mvp-and-revenue.mdx) | First revenue (paid clone/download), MVP hero moments, audience, positioning, evolution. Align roadmap and STATUS with this. |

Optionally we add a **technical** or **architecture** roadmap for infra/architecture items; the product roadmap is the main one for product and editor plans.

Main docs index: [00-docs-index.mdx](../00-docs-index.mdx). Current state and Ralph Wiggum loop: [agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md](../agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md).
