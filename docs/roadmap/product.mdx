# Product roadmap

Forge Agent is an **AI-first interactive narrative storytelling engine** — a **game/narrative content authoring engine**, thin on engine, strong on content and AI. This roadmap tracks editors, platform initiatives, and integrations. Each item follows the **Ralph Wiggum loop**: read STATUS -> implement a slice -> update STATUS and artifacts.

**MVP and first revenue:** We focus on **paid clone/download** and two hero moments (author a small game with AI, or layer Studio + Codebase Agent Strategy on existing projects). See **[MVP and first revenue](../product/mvp-and-revenue.mdx)** for audience, positioning, and evolution. Video editor is **locked until after MVP**.

**Production target:** 2/14. We are in development until then; migration and rollback strategy apply after production.

**For the canonical "what can I do next?" list with impact sizes, see [STATUS.md](../agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md) § Next.**

## Active editors

### Dialogue editor (Yarn Spinner)

**Status:** In progress (primary editor).

**Focus:**

- Yarn Spinner dialogue graph editing (narratives + storylets).
- Plan -> patch -> review -> commit workflow with DockLayout.
- Domain copilot actions and highlights for dialogue graphs.
- Dual graph panels (narrative + storylet) with shared chrome.

### Character editor

**Status:** In progress.

**Focus:**

- Character relationship graph editing with React Flow.
- Tabbed sidebar with node palette and drag-drop creation.
- Character voice integration (ElevenLabs).

### Video editor

**Status:** Locked until after MVP (capability `studio.video.editor`). See [ISSUES.md](../../ISSUES.md).

**Focus (when unlocked):**

- Twick timeline editor surface.
- Track list and timeline panels.
- Pending: map Twick state to VideoDoc draft and connect persistence.

### Strategy editor (CodebaseAgentStrategyEditor)

**Status:** In progress.

**Focus:**

- assistant-ui and tool-ui based chat editor.
- Streaming AI SDK chat endpoint (`/api/assistant-chat`).
- Shared component exported from `@forge/shared` for consumer apps.

**Scope:** Help users define and refine **per-editor strategies** for their
codebases and produce plans and agent artifacts for any coding agent (Cursor,
Codex, Claude, etc.). Support for standard Unity and Unreal codebase
structures is in scope.

## Platform initiatives

### Editors as MCP Apps

**Status:** Planned (next).

**Goal:** Expose each editor as an **MCP App** — a self-contained unit
that MCP hosts (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code) can embed or orchestrate.

**Phases:**

1. Define `McpAppDescriptor` per editor (tools + UI resources).
2. Build Studio MCP Server.
3. Register with MCP hosts; streaming tool results.

**Impact: Large.** Architecture: [07 - Editors as MCP Apps](../architecture/07-modes-as-mcp-apps.mdx).

### First-class Yarn Spinner support

**Status:** Planned (next).

**Goal:** Full integration with the [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev)
dialogue scripting language.

**Scope:**

- Export/import `.yarn` files from dialogue graphs.
- Yarn syntax preview alongside the visual graph.
- Variable panel for declaring and tracking Yarn variables.
- Command palette for common Yarn commands.

**Impact: Medium.** Architecture: [09 - Dialogue system and Yarn Spinner](../architecture/09-dialogue-domain-and-yarn-spinner.mdx).

### Full Yarn Spinner implementation

**Status:** Planned (later).

**Goal:** Complete Yarn Spinner toolchain in-browser.

**Scope:**

- Compile graphs to Yarn bytecode.
- Runtime preview (play through dialogue).
- Localization and string table export.
- Custom commands and functions.
- Unity/Unreal export packages.

## Platform (future)

These items are tracked in STATUS § Next with impact sizes. **First revenue = paid clone/download** (see [MVP and first revenue](../product/mvp-and-revenue.mdx)).

- **Monetization (clone to account / download)** — **MVP-critical.** Users can let others clone a project (or template, or Strategy core) to their account for a price, or download the build. Listings, checkout, Stripe Connect or similar. **Impact: Epic.**
- **Plan tiers and capabilities for platform** — **MVP-critical.** Extend plans and `CAPABILITIES` to gate platform features (e.g. who can list, who can clone/download paid items). **Impact: Small–Medium.**
- **Publish and host project builds** — After MVP. Authors publish a project build; we host playable narrative. Build pipeline, storage, playable runtime. **Impact: Large.**

## Planned editors

### Writer editor

**Status:** Planned.

Notion-inspired page and block model: **pages** and **blocks** Payload collections and CRUD hooks are in place (`usePages`, `usePage`, `useCreatePage`, `useUpdatePage`, `useBlocks`, `useBlock`, `useCreateBlock`, `useUpdateBlock`). Data structure aligns with Notion API concepts (parent, properties, block type + payload). WriterEditor UI and editor shell not yet implemented. Same loop pattern (artifacts + strategy) as other editors; when the editor is built, it will have its own STATUS/decisions/errors-and-attempts for the writing system.

## Other roadmap items

- Vision/image input (model registry + chat upload).
- Co-agents (documented, not used).
- Optional agent graphs/subgraphs in runtime.
- Video workflow panel (plan -> patch -> review) mirroring Dialogue. **Impact: Medium.**
