# Product roadmap

AI-first interactive narrative engine. Ralph Wiggum loop: read STATUS → implement slice → update STATUS.

**MVP:** Dialogue, Character, Writer, GamePlayer. Video and Strategy editor not in MVP. Success = first paid clone E2E. See [MVP](../product/mvp-and-revenue).

**Next:** [STATUS § Next](../agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md). Granular tasks: [task-registry](../agent-artifacts/core/task-registry.md).

## Active editors

| Editor | Status | Focus |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Dialogue | In progress | Yarn Spinner, plan→patch→review, dual graph panels |
| Character | In progress | Relationship graph, ElevenLabs voice |
| GamePlayer | MVP (to build) | Playable Yarn Games runtime |
| Video | Locked | Capability-gated; new timeline/editor TBD when unlocked |
| Strategy | After MVP | Assistant UI chat, downloadable core in scope |

## Platform initiatives

- **LangGraph** — Phase 1 done (@forge/assistant-runtime, Forge/Character workflows); Phase 2 in progress
- **MCP** — Studio + editors as MCP apps; app tools, editor registration (after MVP)
- **Yarn Spinner** — Export/import `.yarn`; full implementation planned (MVP-critical)
- **Dev-kit single entrypoint** — Docs done; package consolidation in progress

**Next:** [Potential ideas](potential-ideas)
