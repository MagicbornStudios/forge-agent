# CopilotKit editor integration

## Pattern: context + actions

- **Context** describes current state so the agent can reason (e.g. which editor, what graph, dirty state). Supply it via `useCopilotReadable` in the editor component or via `useDomainCopilot` contracts.
- **Actions** perform edits. Register them with `useCopilotAction`; the agent calls them to change the graph, document, etc.

The agent uses context to answer questions like "What's in the graph?" and uses actions to apply changes (create node, update node, save, etc.).

## Stable action IDs (conventions)

- App-level actions are prefixed via `createAppAction()` (e.g. `app_generateImage`).
- System actions are prefixed via `createDomainAction(domain, ...)` (e.g. `forge_createNode`).

Even if an action is disabled, it should exist so the UI stays consistent.

## Editor context shape (Dialogue)

Dialogue exposes to the agent:

- `editorId`: `"dialogue"`
- `viewportType`: `"react-flow"` (legacy `editorType`)
- `graphSummary`: `{ title, nodeCount, edgeCount, nodeIds }` or `null` when no graph
- `isDirty`: boolean

Other editors (e.g. Writer/Lexical) can expose their own summary (e.g. document title, word count, selection).

## Selection-aware instructions

When the user says "change this node" or "edit the selected one", the agent should use the current selection. Dialogue can expose selected node IDs by including `selectedNodeIds` in the value passed to `useCopilotReadable` and wiring it from the graph store or React Flow state.

## No imperative toolbar

The agent does not add or remove toolbar buttons. It uses existing actions (Save, graph ops) only.
