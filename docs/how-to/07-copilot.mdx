# 07 - Copilot and AI integration

Context, actions, suggestions, highlights; plan-execute-review-commit; app-level actions. Single source of truth: [architecture/03-copilotkit-and-agents.mdx](../architecture/03-copilotkit-and-agents.mdx).

## Context (what the agent sees)

- **Shell**: `useCopilotReadable` in AppShell -- activeWorkspaceId, openWorkspaceIds, mode labels, editor summary.
- **Domain**: When a mode is active, `useDomainCopilot(contract)` registers `contract.getContextSnapshot()` as readable (domain, workspaceId, selection, selectionSummary, domainState). Domain instructions come from `contract.getInstructions()`.

## Actions (what the agent can do)

- **Shell**: `switchMode`, `openMode`, `closeMode` (no prefix).
- **Domain**: All actions from `contract.createActions()` with domain prefix (e.g. `forge_createNode`, `forge_executePlan`, `forge_commit`). Each registered via `useCopilotAction`.
- **App-level**: Registered in AppShell: `app_generateImage`, `app_respondWithStructure`. Use a neutral prefix so they don't collide with domain actions.

## Suggestions and highlights

- **Suggestions**: `contract.getSuggestions()` -> chips in chat.
- **Highlights**: After an action, handlers can call `onAIHighlight({ entities: { 'forge.node': [id] } })`; the UI highlights those entities briefly. Same `AIHighlightPayload` and `useAIHighlight` across domains.

## Plan-execute-review-commit

Dialogue (and any mode that adopts it): create plan (no draft change) -> plan renders inline in chat via **PlanCard** with Apply/Dismiss -> execute plan (apply steps, set pending) -> **ModeReviewBar** (Revert / Accept) -> commit (save). See Section 11 in [architecture/03-copilotkit-and-agents.mdx](../architecture/03-copilotkit-and-agents.mdx).

## What the AI can do (summary)

At full integration: read mode and domain context; run shell and domain actions; for Dialogue, create/execute plan and commit after review; use app actions for image generation and structured output. Co-agents are documented but not used yet; see [17-co-agents-and-multi-agent.mdx](../17-co-agents-and-multi-agent.mdx).
