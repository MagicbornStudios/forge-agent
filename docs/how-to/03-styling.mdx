# 03 – Styling and theming

Design tokens, editor themes, and where UI atoms live.

## Design tokens

Semantic tokens live in `packages/shared/src/shared/styles/themes.css`: `--background`, `--foreground`, `--border`, `--muted`, etc. Prefer these over raw colors so themes apply consistently.

## App and editor theme

- **App theme**: Driven by `ui.theme` (settings) and `AppThemeProvider`; sets `<html data-theme="...">`. See `apps/studio/components/providers/AppThemeProvider.tsx`.
- **Editor override**: `EditorShell` accepts optional `theme`; sets `data-theme` on the editor root so a single editor can use a different theme (e.g. Video uses `darcula`).

## UI atoms

All shared primitives come from `packages/ui` and are imported as `@forge/ui/button`, `@forge/ui/card`, `@forge/ui/dialog`, etc. Add new atoms via `npx shadcn@latest add <name>` in the UI package. Editor components use these; do not hand-roll equivalents.

See [design/01-styling-and-theming.mdx](../design/01-styling-and-theming.mdx) for full rules.

## What the AI can do at this stage

None — styling only. No agent or actions.
