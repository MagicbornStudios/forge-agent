# 15 – Shadcn registries and UI components

How we use shadcn’s `components.json`, where to add registries, and how to add or build components so they live in the right place (shared vs Studio vs Marketing).

## What is components.json?

`components.json` is the shadcn CLI config for a “project” that owns its own component tree. It defines:

- **Style** (e.g. `new-york`), **RSC**, **Tailwind** paths, **aliases** (where components, utils, lib live).
- **Registries** — named URLs like `@lucide-animated`, `@billingsdk` that the CLI uses to fetch and install components with `shadcn add @namespace/component-name`.

The CLI looks for `components.json` in the **current working directory**. There is no `components.json` at the repo root; each app or package that owns components has its own file.

## Where we have components.json

| Location | Role | Registries |
|----------|------|------------|
| **packages/ui** | Shared atoms and shared registries; output goes into `@forge/ui`. Consumed by apps and by external consumers. | `@lucide-animated`, `@billingsdk` |
| **apps/studio** | Studio-only. Uses `@forge/ui` for base UI. Add app-only registries here if a component is only for Studio. | (none currently) |
| **apps/marketing** | Marketing-only (docs, landing, billing, etc.). Its own molecules/organisms and app-level registries. | magicui, aceternity, tailark, shadcnblocks |

## When to add a registry where

- **Shared** (used across apps or by consumers): Add the registry in **packages/ui**, run the shadcn CLI from `packages/ui`, install the component there, and export it from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`.
- **App-only** (Studio or Marketing only): Add the registry in that app’s `components.json`, run the shadcn CLI from that app’s directory; installed components stay in that app (e.g. `apps/marketing/components/...`).

## How to add a new registry

From the directory that has the `components.json` you want to update:

```bash
cd packages/ui   # for shared
# or: cd apps/studio | cd apps/marketing
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest registry add @namespace
```

Example (shared):

```bash
cd packages/ui && pnpm dlx shadcn@latest registry add @lucide-animated
```

You can also add registries by editing the `registries` object in `components.json` (e.g. `"@namespace": "https://example.com/r/{name}.json"`).

## How to add a component from a registry

From the **same** directory that has the `components.json`:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @namespace/component-name
```

Examples from `packages/ui`:

- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @lucide-animated/icon-name`
- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @billingsdk/pricing-table-one`

After adding to `packages/ui`, export the new component from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`.

```

- **Atoms (and shared “enhanced” components):** Built in `packages/ui`, published as `@forge/ui`. Consumers and internal apps (Studio, Marketing) import from here.
- **Molecules/organisms for product:** `packages/shared` (e.g. WorkspaceShell) — published; **apps/studio** — internal-only (ForgeWorkspace, VideoWorkspace, AppShell, etc.), not shipped.
- **Molecules/organisms for go-to-market:** **apps/marketing** — internal-only (HeroSection, MarketingSidebar, billing pages, docs, etc.); not shipped; can use app-level registries for one-off marketing/docs/billing UI.

## Summary: which components.json to use

| Goal | Use components.json in | Where installed components live |
|------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Shared UI (atoms, animated icons, billing components) | **packages/ui** | `packages/ui/src/components/ui/`; export from `index.ts` |
| Studio-only component | **apps/studio** | `apps/studio/components/...` |
| Marketing-only component (landing, docs, billing page UI) | **apps/marketing** | `apps/marketing/components/...` |
