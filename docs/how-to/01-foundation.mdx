# 01 – Foundation

Repo structure, packages, and key concepts so you can run the app and navigate the codebase.

## Repo structure

- **apps/studio/** — Next.js app: App Shell, workspaces, CopilotKit, Payload, API routes.
- **packages/shared/** — Workspace UI kit and headless contracts (`WorkspaceShell`, slots, toolbar, overlays).
- **packages/domain-forge/** — Forge domain: types, operations, Copilot contract (actions, context, suggestions).
- **packages/ui/** — shadcn UI atoms (Button, Card, Dialog, etc.).
- **packages/types/** — Payload-generated types and domain aliases (`ForgeGraphDoc`, etc.).
- **docs/** — Documentation; how-tos live in `docs/how-to/`.

## Key concepts

- **App Shell**: Owns workspace tabs and active workspace. Only one workspace is mounted at a time. See `apps/studio/components/AppShell.tsx` and `apps/studio/lib/app-shell/store.ts`.
- **Workspace**: A domain-specific editor (Forge = graph, Video = timeline). Each uses `WorkspaceShell` from shared and composes Header, Toolbar, LayoutGrid, StatusBar, Overlays.
- **Domain**: Logic and Copilot contract for a workspace (e.g. `packages/domain-forge`). Types come from `packages/types`.

## Running the app

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Configure `.env.local` (e.g. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `PAYLOAD_SECRET`). After changing Payload collections, run `pnpm payload:types`.

## What the AI can do at this stage

N/A — concepts only. No workspace or agent wiring yet.
