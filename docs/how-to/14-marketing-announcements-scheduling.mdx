# 14 - Platform announcements and scheduling

How promotions work for customer-facing surfaces.

## Promotions collection

- **Collection:** `promotions` in Studio.
- **Fields:** `title`, `body`, `active`, `startsAt`, `endsAt`, `ctaUrl`.
- **API:** `GET /api/promotions` returns active promotions for current time window.

## Scheduling with Payload Jobs

- Tasks: `activatePromotion` and `deactivatePromotion` in `apps/studio/payload/tasks`.
- Queue jobs from promotions `afterChange` hook when `startsAt`/`endsAt` are in the future.
- Payload Jobs need a long-running worker process; pure serverless is not enough for delayed execution.

## Serverless fallback

Use external cron to hit a Studio route that toggles active/inactive promotions by time window.
