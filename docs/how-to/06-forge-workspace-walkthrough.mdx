# 06 - DialogueMode walkthrough (React Flow + AI)

This guide walks through **DialogueMode** (formerly ForgeWorkspace), which
builds YarnSpinner-style dialogue graphs with React Flow and an AI
plan -> patch -> review -> commit loop.

## Goal

Build a DialogueMode that:
- Renders a React Flow graph editor inside the shared editor shell.
- Uses a draft graph in Zustand with patch operations.
- Supports AI plan -> patch -> review -> commit with streamed output.
- Highlights changed nodes and edges after AI actions or patch acceptance.

## 0. EditorApp + AppProviders (app-level)

DialogueMode lives inside the **App Shell**, which uses `EditorApp`. Providers
are centralized in `AppProviders` so a consumer app can drop in the shell with
minimal setup.

```tsx
// apps/studio/components/AppShell.tsx
return (
  <EditorApp>
    <EditorApp.Tabs>...</EditorApp.Tabs>
    <EditorApp.Content>...</EditorApp.Content>
  </EditorApp>
);
```

```tsx
// apps/studio/app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <AppProviders>
      <AppShell />
    </AppProviders>
  );
}
```

Expected behavior:
- App shell layout is consistent across apps.
- Providers (Copilot, tooltips, entitlements) are composed once.

## 1. Create the editor shell

Start with the shared editor shell and slots. The shell owns layout; the mode
owns state and content.

```tsx
// apps/studio/components/modes/DialogueMode.tsx
return (
  <EditorShell
    modeId="dialogue"
    title="Dialogue"
    subtitle={graph?.title}
    domain="dialogue"
    theme={workspaceTheme}
    className="flex flex-col h-full min-h-0 bg-background"
  >
    <ModeHeader>...</ModeHeader>
    <ModeToolbar>...</ModeToolbar>
    <DockLayout main={mainPanel} right={inspectorPanel} bottom={bottomPanel} />
    <ModeStatusBar>...</ModeStatusBar>
    <ModeOverlaySurface ... />
  </EditorShell>
);
```

Expected behavior:
- The shell provides consistent layout and theming.
- The editor surface and inspector are just slots.

## 2. Draft state + patch ops

Draft state lives in `useForgeGraphsStore`. All edits are applied via patch ops
(`ForgeGraphPatchOp`) so AI and humans follow the same mutation pipeline.

Key file: `apps/studio/lib/domains/forge/store.ts`.

Expected behavior:
- All edits are patch ops; no direct mutation of `graph.flow`.
- `isDirty` is true after any patch.

## 3. Editor surface + selection

React Flow is rendered in the main slot. Selection is converted to the shared
`Selection` contract so the inspector and AI use a common model.

Key file: `apps/studio/components/GraphEditor.tsx` and selection mapping in
`apps/studio/components/modes/DialogueMode.tsx`.

Expected behavior:
- Selection and highlighting are controlled by the mode, not the editor.
- The editor is a pure surface; all state comes from props.

## 4. Inspector sections

Selection-driven inspector sections live in `forgeInspectorSections`, then are
rendered with `WorkspaceInspector` inside a `DockPanel`.

Key file: `apps/studio/components/forge/ForgeInspectorSections.tsx`.

Expected behavior:
- Only sections whose `when(selection)` returns true are shown.
- Inspector remains declarative and selection-driven.

## 5. AI workflow (plan -> patch -> review)

DialogueMode registers the Forge contract with `useDomainCopilot`, and renders
`ForgeWorkflowPanel` inside the inspector. The workflow panel streams a plan,
applies patches, and shows a review bar before commit.

Key files:
- `packages/domain-forge/src/copilot`
- `apps/studio/components/forge/ForgeWorkflowPanel.tsx`

Expected behavior:
- Plan renders in chat (PlanCard + PlanActionBar).
- Patches apply to draft, and `ModeReviewBar` appears for accept/revert.
- Accept commits the draft (save); Revert reloads server state.

## 6. DockLayout + panels

DialogueMode uses `DockLayout` for resizable panels. The left panel uses
`PanelTabs` for graph lists and node palette; the right panel uses
`WorkspaceInspector`; the bottom panel hosts the workbench.

Key file: `apps/studio/components/modes/DialogueMode.tsx`.

Expected behavior:
- Users can resize panels; sizes persist when `layoutId` is provided.
- Panels can be hidden via settings (`panel.visible.*`).
