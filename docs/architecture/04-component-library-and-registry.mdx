# Component library + private registry (Verdaccio)

This repo is both **the Studio app** and the **source of publishable building blocks** for other teams. We publish only **foundation packages** (UI, editor shell, Copilot utilities). Domain packages stay private.

---

## What we publish (public surface)

### `@forge/ui`
- Shadcn/Radix atoms and form primitives.
- No app or system (domain) dependencies.

### `@forge/shared`
- Editor shell, DockLayout primitives, and editor scaffolding.
- EditorApp + AppProviders for app-shell structure and provider wiring.
- Copilot helpers (`useDomainCopilot`, action config types, generative UI).
- App/editor/viewport contracts.
- Assistant UI and tool UI components for Strategy editor.

### `@forge/agent-engine`
- Generic workflow runtime (steps + events + SSE helpers).
- Public and system-agnostic; system workflows live in app/domain packages.

### `@forge/dev-kit`
- Convenience meta-package that re-exports `@forge/ui`, `@forge/shared`, and `@forge/agent-engine`.
- Use this when you want a single dependency.

### Not published (kept internal)
- `@forge/domain-*` (system logic and app-specific UI).
- `@forge/types` (Payload-generated types tied to this repo).

---

## Shadcn registries and components.json

We have three `components.json` files (no config at repo root):

- **packages/ui** - shared atoms and **shared registries**; components here are published as `@forge/ui`. Shared registries: `@lucide-animated`, `@billingsdk`.
- **apps/studio** - Studio-only; uses `@forge/ui` for base UI; add app-only registries here if needed.
- **apps/marketing** - Marketing-only; has its own registries (e.g. magicui, aceternity) for app-level components.

To add a new shared registry or install components from a registry, see [How-to 15 - Shadcn registries and UI components](../how-to/15-shadcn-registries-and-components.mdx).

---

## Package layout and build outputs

Published packages are compiled to `dist/` and export:

- `dist/index.esm.js` (ESM)
- `dist/index.cjs.js` (CJS)
- `dist/index.d.ts` (types)

Each package has:

- `exports` map for ESM/CJS/types
- `publishConfig.registry` set to Verdaccio
- `build` script using `tsup`

---

## Local registry: Verdaccio

### Start Verdaccio

```bash
pnpm registry:start
# or: verdaccio --config ./verdaccio.yaml
```

Verdaccio runs at: `http://localhost:4873`

### Registry scope

Repo root `.npmrc` is scoped:

```ini
@forge:registry=http://localhost:4873
```

This ensures only `@forge/*` packages go to the local registry.

### Verdaccio config (repo-local)

We keep a lightweight config at `verdaccio.yaml`:

- Storage in `./verdaccio/storage`
- Publishes allowed without auth (local dev)
- Proxies public packages from npmjs

---

## Publish flow (local)

From repo root:

```bash
pnpm --filter @forge/ui build
pnpm --filter @forge/shared build
pnpm --filter @forge/agent-engine build
pnpm --filter @forge/dev-kit build
```

Then publish each package (one time or after changes):

```bash
cd packages/ui
npm publish

cd ../shared
npm publish

cd ../agent-engine
npm publish

cd ../dev-kit
npm publish
```

> If Verdaccio requires login, run `npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873`.

---

## Consume from another repo

In the consumer repo root:

`.npmrc`
```ini
@forge:registry=http://localhost:4873
```

`package.json`
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@forge/dev-kit": "^0.1.0"
  }
}
```

Install:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Usage:

```ts
import { EditorShell, DockLayout, Button } from '@forge/dev-kit';
import { ForgeCopilotProvider, createForgeCopilotRuntime } from '@forge/dev-kit';
```

### Local consumer example

This repo includes a minimal consumer app at `examples/consumer/` that demonstrates:

- EditorApp layout
- AppProviders + Copilot sidebar
- CodebaseAgentStrategyEditor (assistant-ui + tool-ui)
- `/api/copilotkit` using `createForgeCopilotRuntime`
- `/api/assistant-chat` for the strategy editor

---

## AI out-of-the-box (OpenRouter)

To use the Copilot helpers, consumers must provide:

- **OpenRouter API key** (e.g. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) in their app runtime.
- A CopilotKit runtime route or equivalent backend that calls OpenRouter.

The contract is the same as this repo:

1. Provide a CopilotKit provider (app shell).
2. Register **system contracts** via `useDomainCopilot()` in each editor.
3. Provide app-level actions using helpers like `createAppAction()`.

### Next.js runtime wrapper

`@forge/shared` exports a **Next.js-only** runtime wrapper and provider:

- `createForgeCopilotRuntime(...)` - returns a `POST` handler for `/api/copilotkit`.
- `ForgeCopilotProvider` - wraps `CopilotKit` + `CopilotSidebar` with minimal config props.

This keeps adoption fast for Next apps without forcing a custom runtime.

> **Studio note:** The Studio app keeps a custom `/api/copilotkit` route for model routing and fallbacks. The wrapper is meant for consumers who want the fastest integration path.

---

## Action helper prefixes (whitelabeled)

We expose helpers to keep action naming consistent:

- `createAppAction()` -> prefixes `app_`
- `createDomainAction(domain)` -> prefixes `<domain>_` (system prefix)

These live in `@forge/shared` and are exported alongside Copilot contracts.

---

## Versioning and compatibility

- Start at `0.1.x` while the public surface is still settling.
- Keep action config shapes backward compatible.
- Avoid breaking editor shell props without a major bump.

---

## Agent guidance

- **Only publish foundation packages** (`@forge/ui`, `@forge/shared`, `@forge/agent-engine`, `@forge/dev-kit`).
- Keep `domain-*` private (system packages).
- Avoid exporting app-specific code from shared.
- Update this doc when the public surface or registry strategy changes.
