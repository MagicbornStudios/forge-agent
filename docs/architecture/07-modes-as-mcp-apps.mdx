# Editors as MCP Apps

Each editor in Studio can be exposed as an **MCP App** — a self-contained
unit that an external MCP host (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, or another
MCP-aware client) can embed or orchestrate.

---

## What is an MCP App?

An MCP App bundles two things:

1. **Tools** — functions the host agent can invoke (create node, run plan,
   query graph state, etc.).
2. **UI Resources** — React component trees the host can render in its own
   surface (panel, sidebar, overlay).

The MCP protocol handles discovery, invocation, and streaming; Studio provides
the implementations.

## Architecture

```
MCP Host (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
  │
  ├── discovers available apps via MCP registry
  │
  ├── invokes tools ──► Studio MCP Server
  │                         ├── DialogueApp tools
  │                         ├── CharacterApp tools
  │                         ├── VideoApp tools
  │                         └── StrategyApp tools
  │
  └── renders UI resources ──► React component trees
                                 exported from @forge/shared
```

### Studio MCP Server

A lightweight server (Node or edge) that:

- Registers each editor's tools with the MCP registry.
- Handles tool invocations by delegating to system logic.
- Serves UI resources as serialized component descriptors.

### Per-editor app descriptor

Each editor exports an `McpAppDescriptor`:

```ts
interface McpAppDescriptor {
  id: string;              // e.g. 'dialogue', 'character'
  name: string;            // human-readable
  tools: McpToolDef[];     // tool definitions
  uiResources: McpUiResource[];  // component descriptors
}
```

## Editor → MCP App mapping

| Editor | MCP App ID | Tools | UI Resources |
|------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Dialogue | `dialogue` | createNode, updateNode, deleteNode, getGraph, runPlan | Graph editor, node palette, plan review |
| Character | `character` | createElement, updateElement, createLink, getGraph | Character graph, relationship inspector |
| Video | `video` | addTrack, updateElement, getTimeline | Timeline surface, track list |
| Strategy | `strategy` | sendMessage, getThreads, runTool | Chat thread, tool activity feed |

---

## Embedding editors externally

A consumer app can embed an editor in two ways:

### 1. Full component embed

Import the editor component from `@forge/shared` or `@forge/dev-kit` and render
it directly:

```tsx
import { CodebaseAgentStrategyEditor } from '@forge/dev-kit';

<CodebaseAgentStrategyEditor apiUrl="/api/assistant-chat" />
```

### 2. MCP tool + resource embed

The MCP host discovers the editor's tools and UI resources, then renders them in
its own surface. The host calls tools to drive behavior and displays the UI
resource for visual feedback.

---

## Roadmap

| Phase | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| **Now** | Editors work as in-app tabs within Studio. Consumer example uses component embed. |
| **Next** | Define `McpAppDescriptor` per editor. Build Studio MCP Server. |
| **Later** | Register with MCP hosts. Streaming tool results. Cross-editor orchestration. |
