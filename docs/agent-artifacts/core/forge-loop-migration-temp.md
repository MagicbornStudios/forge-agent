# Forge Loop migration temp

Temporary working document for migration-era refactors until `.planning` is initialized.

## How to use this

- Capture short, actionable refactor tasks needed to move into Forge Loop.
- Keep entries small enough to map into a single phase plan task.
- After running `forge-loop new-project`, move active items into `.planning/TEMP-REFACTOR-BACKLOG.md`.

## Intake

- [ ] Document current docs/platform gaps that block phase planning.
- [ ] Capture refactors required to align components with product direction.
- [ ] Identify blockers that require decisions before execution.

## Mapping to phase plans

| Temp item | Target phase | Plan id | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| _fill in_ | _fill in_ | _fill in_ | open |
