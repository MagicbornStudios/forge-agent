# Status

> **For coding agents.** See [Agent artifacts index](../../18-agent-artifacts-index.mdx) for the full list.

## Current

- **Production target:** 2/14. Core and Ralph Wiggum loop only; no legacy or deprecated code in the editor platform.
- **Product vision**: Forge Agent is an AI-first interactive narrative storytelling engine (game/narrative content authoring, thin engine, AI- and chat-first) with Yarn Spinner compatible dialogue editing (Yarn export in MVP), character relationship graphs, video timeline (not in MVP), and Codebase Agent Strategy (downloadable core in scope; Strategy editor not in MVP). First revenue: **paid clone/download**. **MVP editors** = Dialogue, Character, Writer, GamePlayer. **Video** and **Strategy (codebase) editor** are **not in MVP**. **Creators list from day one.** **MVP infra** = Vercel + Payload. **Platform** = marketing site (landing + platform). **MVP success** = first paid clone completed end-to-end. **Publish and host playable builds** is part of MVP so authors can publish a build and others can play via URL. **TRACE** = part of MVP for Strategy (downloadable core) proof only; not for Studio or platform. Paid + free tier; catalog (users + orgs); clone semantics; revenue share. Writer = Lexical, branching, Yarn Games. MVP technical bar: simple game on graphs, all AI/image/audio/gen working, AI-first. Dev-kit: editor components for AI; OpenRouter first-class; ElevenLabs + Sora for advanced; cloud subscription for standard users. See [product roadmap](../../roadmap/product.mdx), [MVP and first revenue](../../product/mvp-and-revenue.mdx), and [Dev-kit and keys](../../product/dev-kit-and-keys.mdx).
- **Apps**: Studio in `apps/studio`; consumer-facing marketing site in `apps/marketing` (landing, docs, login, account, billing, waitlist, newsletter). Marketing shares Payload (Studio) for auth and data; set `NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_APP_URL` for API and "Open app" link.
- **pnpm workspaces**: Root scripts filter to `@forge/studio`. Shared packages live under `packages/*`.
- **Shared UI kit**: `packages/shared/src/shared` provides EditorShell, DockLayout (Dockview docking + floating groups), DockPanel, PanelTabs, and theme tokens. Design language: [03-design-language.mdx](../../design/03-design-language.mdx) (Spotify tone, soft-modern, shadcn-first; Unreal/Unity for structure only).
- **Assistant UI + tool UI**: shared components live in `packages/shared/src/shared/components/assistant-ui` and `packages/shared/src/shared/components/tool-ui` for the Strategy editor and consumer example.
- **Shared atoms**: `packages/ui` hosts shadcn primitives used across the app and shared UI.
- **Public packages**: `@forge/ui`, `@forge/shared`, `@forge/agent-engine`, and `@forge/dev-kit` are publishable via Verdaccio for consumers.
- **Vendored Twick**: Twick is vendored at `vendor/twick` as a git submodule; pnpm workspace overrides resolve `@twick/*` from the vendored packages. See [How-to 24](../../how-to/24-vendoring-third-party-code.mdx).
- **Copilot runtime wrapper**: `@forge/shared/copilot/next` exports `createForgeCopilotRuntime(...)` and `ForgeCopilotProvider` (Next.js only).
- **Entitlements & gates**: Capability registry + `FeatureGate` are in shared; Studio provides a local entitlements store and paywall sheet.
- **Plan UI**: Dialogue plans render in chat with `PlanCard` + `PlanActionBar` and `ForgePlanCard`, then review in the editor via `EditorReviewBar`.
- **Workflow runtime**: `packages/agent-engine` provides a minimal workflow engine (steps + events), SSE route at `POST /api/workflows/run`, and a streaming hook in `apps/studio/lib/ai/use-workflow-run.ts`.
- **Dialogue system**: `packages/domain-forge` contains Dialogue logic and copilot wiring (domain package = system). Video remains a UI showcase under `apps/studio/lib/domains/video` (not a focus).
- **Video editor**: Not in MVP. Locked until after MVP (capability `studio.video.editor`). Twick surface remains wired; do not assign Video work until MVP (paid clone/download) is in place. See [ISSUES.md](../../ISSUES.md) and [MVP and first revenue](../../product/mvp-and-revenue.mdx).
- **GamePlayer**: MVP editor (playable runtime for Yarn Games); to be built.
- **Strategy editor**: Not in MVP; downloadable core + TRACE in scope for MVP. In-app Strategy editor ships after MVP.
- **App shell**: `EditorApp` is the semantic root for AppLayout; Studio composes providers via `AppProviders` for drop-in usage. Global assistant chat: Cmd+K or Ctrl+Shift+P (or Help → Show All Commands) opens `AssistantChatPopup` (Dialog with same assistant UI as Dialogue drawer).
- **Consumer example**: `examples/consumer` shows a minimal Next app using `@forge/dev-kit` and `CodebaseAgentStrategyEditor` with `/api/assistant-chat`.
- **Docs**: In-app docs render MDX with JSX components (next-mdx-remote/rsc) and include migration + AI generation guides.
- **Dialogue editor**: Dual narrative/storylet graphs per project with shared chrome (DockLayout dockable panels, PanelTabs). Project is selected at app level (see below). Yarn Spinner integration planned (export/import `.yarn` files, syntax preview, variable tracking).
- **Strategy editor**: CodebaseAgentStrategyEditor using assistant-ui + tool-ui; streaming chat with tool rendering; thread management.
- **Editors as MCP Apps**: Architecture defined; each editor exposable as MCP App (tool + UI resource) for external hosts. See [07 - Editors as MCP Apps](../../architecture/07-modes-as-mcp-apps.mdx).
- **Character editor**: Aligned chrome with tabbed sidebar and node palette; drag-drop creates characters. Project is selected at app level.
- **Forge graphs**: Collection includes `project` and `kind` fields; types regenerated.
- **Payload + types**: Collections in `apps/studio/payload/collections`: users, projects, forge-graphs, video-docs, settings-overrides, agent-sessions; marketing: waitlist, newsletter-subscribers, promotions. Custom API routes: `POST /api/waitlist`, `POST /api/newsletter`, `GET /api/promotions`. Types in `packages/types/src/payload-types.ts`.
- **Seeded data**: Payload seeds an admin user, a basic user, a demo graph, and a demo project on init (`apps/studio/payload/seed.ts`).
- **Settings overrides persisted**: Yes. Overrides are stored in `settings-overrides`; loaded on init via `GET /api/settings` and `hydrateFromOverrides`; saved explicitly via Save button and `POST /api/settings`. When authenticated, overrides are per-user (optional `user` relation; GET/POST filter by current user).

## Ralph Wiggum loop

- Done (2026-02-10): Settings dock panel and layout refactor: (1) Dock layout persisted via Zustand in app-shell store (`dockLayouts`, `setDockLayout`, `clearDockLayout`); DockLayout supports controlled mode (`layoutJson`, `onLayoutChange`, `clearLayout`). (2) Dialogue, Character, Video editors wire layout to store; View menu "Restore all panels" calls `restoreAllPanels()` + `layoutRef.current?.resetLayout()`; "Reset layout" item added. (3) Settings as dock panel: `AppSettingsPanelContent` extracted; Dialogue right panel has Inspector | Settings tabs; "Open Settings" (View menu + app bar via `requestOpenSettings`) switches to Settings tab and shows right panel; OpenSettingsSheetContext triggers `setRequestOpenSettings(true)` (no sheet in main flow). Docs: architecture README state table, decisions.md DockLayout.
- Done (2026-02-10): Character upsert + dialog standardization slice: editor overlay/dialog sizing standardized (`sm/md/lg/full` compact mapping with constrained full), close affordance standardized to top-right icon button, `CreateCharacterModal` refactored into reusable upsert contract (`character?`, `onCreate`, `onUpdate`) with shadcn form sections (Basics, Prompt, Voice, Media), auto-save-before-media generation flow added, and interim entity media/prompt persistence implemented in `character.meta` via `apps/studio/lib/domains/character/media-meta.ts`. ActiveCharacterPanel now supports edit entrypoint and inline media lists/actions. Doc scan + updates: `docs/design/03-design-language.mdx`, `docs/design/02-components.mdx`, `docs/agent-artifacts/core/styling-and-ui-consistency.md`, `docs/how-to/22-ai-generation-components.mdx`, `docs/agent-artifacts/core/errors-and-attempts.md`, `docs/agent-artifacts/core/task-breakdown-ui-polish.md`, `docs/agent-artifacts/core/task-registry.md`, and `docs/agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md`.

- Done (2026-02-10): Menubar cleanup follow-up: Assistant tab removed from Dialogue drawer, State items fold into File via createEditorMenubarMenus, and app menubar keeps Save in File; docs updated (shared editor README, styling-and-ui-consistency, STATUS).
- Done (2026-02-10): State menubar removed and graph-state ideas captured: DialogueEditor no longer contributes State menu (removed stateMenuItems); four proposed entries added to enhanced-features-backlog (dialogue graph state as JSON, IDs/validation, relinking, cross-editor delete warnings); STATUS § Ideas updated with pointer to backlog.
- Done (2026-02-10): Cmd+K assistant popup polish + model recovery: refreshed `AssistantChatPopup` shell spacing/contrast, wired assistant-ui composer model switcher (`provider="assistantUi"`), tightened model switcher chips/badges/icon rhythm, reduced duplicate settings fetches, and added stale-model fallback resolution (legacy `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` -> valid registry model) across model-settings, assistant-chat, and Copilot resolver. Doc scan/update: errors-and-attempts, styling-and-ui-consistency, design components, STATUS.
- Done (2026-02-10): UI polish pass: tokenized menu/command/select padding and icon sizes in @forge/ui; tightened badge padding and outline contrast; updated ModelSwitcher spacing, SectionHeader badge/icon sizing, NodePalette icon/padding; added UI polish breakdown (task-registry + task-breakdown-ui-polish), updated design docs (01/02/03), styling-and-ui-consistency, errors-and-attempts, coding-agent-strategy, and standard-practices with doc-scan requirement.
- Done (2026-02-09): ModelSwitcher popover refresh: added header/spacing/contrast for search + chips; new `PopoverContent portalled={false}` support to keep Copilot sidebar open when selecting models; logged fix in errors-and-attempts and styling rules.
- Done (2026-02-09): Stabilized app menubar contribution updates (structural compare + unmount-only clear) and memoized CopilotKit readable/actions in AppShell to cut render loops and excess CopilotKit sync calls.
- Done (2026-02-09): Fixed `useEditorPanelVisibility` to use `useShallow` so panel visibility selectors are referentially stable (no `getSnapshot` warning / update-depth loop in editor menubar).
- Done (2026-02-09): Chat-bottom model switching slice complete: model ids persist per-user in settings-overrides (`ai.model.copilot`, `ai.model.assistantUi`) with server cache; `/api/model-settings`, CopilotKit handler, and assistant-chat resolve persisted ids; ModelSwitcher moved to composer variant with search/filter chips + paid-model upgrade group + persisted responses-v2 toggle; Copilot custom input added with composer model switcher and feature-gated attachments/dictation/voice-mode controls; assistant-ui strategy thread composer gained slot-based trailing controls, dictation adapter wiring, and feature-gated attachment/mic/voice controls; toolbar model switchers removed from Dialogue/Character/Video/Strategy.

- Done (2026-02-09): Dev-kit CSS bundle: dockview base + overrides bundled in @forge/shared (dist/styles/editor.css) and re-exported by @forge/dev-kit; Studio and examples/consumer use single `@import '@forge/shared/styles/editor'` / `@import '@forge/dev-kit/styles/editor'`; no dockview import in user code.
- Done (2026-02-09): dev-kit-css-2 — single style import documented in 04 (Consume) and in customer docs (api-reference/dev-kit.md Editor styles); no dockview in user code.
- Done (2026-02-09): dev-kit-ui-1 — one recommended path for UI atoms documented in customer docs (dev-kit.md: use `ui` namespace from @forge/dev-kit); components/index.md updated.
- Done (2026-02-09): Label defaults, menubar extension docs, per-editor panel toggles: (1) Label: documented in `packages/ui` (label.tsx JSDoc + AGENTS.md) and styling-and-ui-consistency rule 12; no Studio accent on Label found. (2) Menubar: "App menubar (Unreal-style)" subsection in packages/shared/.../editor/README.md with extension pattern (shared vs editor menus, new editor).

- Done (2026-02-09): Settings menu in editor menubar: app-level Settings (theme, density, user, Open Settings sheet) moved from app bar into editor menubar next to File/View/State. OpenSettingsSheetContext + useAppSettingsMenuItems; editors use EditorSettingsTrigger in toolbar to open the single settings sheet; AppBarSettingsMenu removed; styling-and-ui-consistency rule 11 updated.
- Done (2026-02-09): Single settings surface and naming: SettingsDrawer renamed to AppSettingsSheet, OpenSettingsDrawerContext to OpenSettingsSheetContext/useOpenSettingsSheet; sheet rendered at AppShell root. All four editors use EditorSettingsTrigger in EditorShell.Settings; SettingsMenu and single-scope SettingsSheet removed.

- Done (2026-02-07): Workspace removed from public API (Option A): Removed `export * from './shared/components/workspace'`; workspace folder deprecated; all consumers updated to Editor* and `@forge/shared`; docs and AGENTS updated; workspace-metadata deprecated in favor of editor-metadata. Verification: no apps/packages (outside internal workspace folder) import from `@forge/shared/components/workspace` or `@forge/shared/workspace`.
- Done (2026-02-07): Vendored Twick as a git submodule (`vendor/twick`), wired pnpm workspace overrides for `@twick/*`, and documented the vendor contribution workflow (How-to 24).
- Done (2026-02-07): Added Forge publish scripts (`registry:forge:build`, `registry:forge:publish:local`), documented Verdaccio optional login + 409 reset flow, and aligned vendor workflow guidance for humans/agents.
- Done (2026-02-07): Project switching at app level: `activeProjectId` in app-shell store; ProjectSwitcher in AppShell tab bar; Dialogue and Character editors consume shared project context; decisions and errors-and-attempts updated.
- Done (2026-02-07): Design system styling review: Token system documented in design/01 (layers, when to use which, file map, context-aware UI); duplicate `@layer base` removed from globals.css; GraphSidebar uses sidebar tokens for contrast; React Flow theme overrides in graph.css (viewport, default node, default edge); ThemeSwitcher includes density (compact/comfortable) with persist; errors-and-attempts "Theme/surface tokens" and styling-and-ui-consistency references updated.
- Done (2026-02-07): User-scoped settings-overrides: optional `user` relation on collection; GET/POST `/api/settings` use payload.auth and filter by current user; theme and app/editor settings persist per user when logged in. See decisions.md.
- Done (2026-02-07): Forge publish pipeline unblocked: deduped React types for DTS, stripped `ref` in assistant-ui markdown components, replaced tool-ui `style jsx` with plain `<style>`, added `moduleResolution: bundler` tsconfigs for agent-engine/dev-kit, namespaced dev-kit UI exports, added Verdaccio htpasswd auth, and fixed publish scripts to use `./` paths. `registry:forge:build` and `registry:forge:publish:local` succeed.
- Done (2026-02-07): Toolbar theme switching: ghost button variant given semantic default state (`bg-transparent text-foreground`) in packages/ui so toolbar controls update when theme changes; ProjectSwitcher trigger uses outline variant for app bar consistency. See errors-and-attempts "Toolbar buttons not switching with theme"; after screenshot optional in docs/images/ (e.g. `toolbar_themes_after.png`).
- Done (2026-02-09): Tech-debt small tasks (td-1–td-3, td-9, td-10): clarified workspace deprecated in shared API (index, AGENTS, editor README); fixed EditorShell JSDoc (removed data-mode-id); verified single home for editor types; SectionHeader + NodePalette use --context-accent; documented editor color context in editor README and 01-styling-and-theming.mdx.

- In progress: None.
- Other agents: None reported.
- Done: CopilotKit architecture doc + roadmap implementation (image gen, structured output, plan-execute-review-commit).
- **Next (tomorrow):** **AI agent and model provider plan** — Discuss and document: who provides models, how model switcher talks to CopilotKit, load sequence. Then **model switcher stability** (massive errors; reduce and single source of truth) and **CopilotKit/Studio load** (too many calls on Studio load; defer or batch). After that, MVP-critical (Yarn, GamePlayer). See STATUS § Next "AI / model routing (stability)" and [task registry](./task-registry.md) initiative `model-routing-copilotkit-stability`.
- Next slice (after AI stability): **MVP-critical work first** — e.g. First-class Yarn Spinner (export/import `.yarn`), then GamePlayer first slice (see [10 - GamePlayer](../../architecture/10-gameplayer.mdx)), or publish and host builds. Video work (Twick → VideoDoc, workflow panel) is **when Video is unlocked** (not in MVP).

## Next

### Impact sizes

- **Small** — Single area, few files, one PR (e.g. add a capability constant, gate one UI surface).
- **Medium** — One clear slice across API + UI or data (e.g. project-scoped settings API + one settings surface).
- **Large** — Multi-slice, multiple areas (e.g. publish/host pipeline: build artifact, storage, playable runtime).
- **Epic** — Multi-week, many slices and docs (e.g. full platform monetization: listing, checkout, clone, payouts).

### What you can do next

**Where to look:** The list below is the canonical next steps; each item has an **impact size**. For more context, see [product roadmap](../../roadmap/product.mdx) and [enhanced-features backlog](./enhanced-features-backlog.md).

**Granular tasks:** For **breakdowns and pickable small tasks** (by tier, impact, status), see [task-registry.md](./task-registry.md) and [task-breakdown-system.md](./task-breakdown-system.md). Prefer Tier 3 (Small) or Tier 2 (Medium) open tasks when you want a single PR.

**Ordering:** **Yarn Spinner** and **GamePlayer** are **part of MVP**; do them before or alongside platform monetization. **Editors as MCP Apps** is **after MVP**. Prefer **MVP-critical** items when picking work. **Video** items below are for **when Video is unlocked** (Video is not in MVP). See [decisions: MVP ordering and what to do next](./decisions.md).

**How to pick work:** Next work can be **coding** (STATUS § Next, [task registry](./task-registry.md)) or **business/strategy doc work** (marketing plan, content calendar, unit economics, ecosystem strategy, investor narrative, etc.); those live in `docs/business/` and `docs/product/` and can be updated in the same loop (read STATUS → do one slice or doc update → update STATUS/Done). For coding: prefer **one slice per item**; use impact size to scope (Small = one PR, Epic = break into slices and track in STATUS). To pull an **easy small task**, open the [task registry](./task-registry.md) and pick a Tier 3 (or Tier 2) item with `status: open`; if it belongs to an initiative, use the breakdown doc for context and parent reference. When you start an item, set its status to `in_progress` in the [task registry](./task-registry.md) or the initiative's [breakdown doc](./task-breakdown-system.md) (whichever lists that task), and add "In progress: …" in the Ralph Wiggum section above so other agents or contributors don't pick the same work.

**Business / strategy doc work (examples):** Ecosystem and import strategy (see [ecosystem-and-import-strategy.mdx](../../business/ecosystem-and-import-strategy.mdx)); marketing plan (emails, newsletters, content scheduling); unit economics and revenue one-pager; investor narrative / one-pager. These count as valid "next" work when picking what to do.

**Ideas and potential roadmap:** See [potential ideas](../../roadmap/potential-ideas.md) to triage or add exploratory ideas; when accepted, add to STATUS § Next, task registry, or enhanced-features backlog. **Dialogue graph state / state-editor ideas** (graph state as JSON, IDs/validation, relinking, cross-editor delete warnings) are in [enhanced-features-backlog](./enhanced-features-backlog.md) as proposed; discuss and accept there before implementing.

### Next steps (with impact sizes)

**AI / model routing / CopilotKit (stability — do first tomorrow)**

0. **AI agent and model provider plan** — Discuss and document: who provides models (OpenRouter vs others), how the model switcher integrates with CopilotKit, and the intended load sequence. Single source of truth for model state; avoid duplicate fetches and sync loops. **[Impact: Small – planning/doc]**
1. **Model switcher stability** — Model switcher is producing many errors (sync, registry, UI). Reduce errors: ensure single source of truth (settings ⇄ router), registry hydrated once, no oscillation. See [errors-and-attempts](./errors-and-attempts.md) (Model switcher registry empty, manual mode oscillation) and [06-model-routing-and-openrouter.mdx](../../architecture/06-model-routing-and-openrouter.mdx). **[Impact: Small–Medium]**
2. **CopilotKit and Studio: reduce calls on load** — Too many CopilotKit/Studio calls on app load. Defer non-critical requests, batch where possible, single init path for runtime/sync so "what's next" is clear. **[Impact: Small–Medium]**

**MVP (do after AI stability)**

3. **First-class Yarn Spinner** — **MVP-critical.** Yarn export (and import) is in MVP. Export/import `.yarn` files; syntax preview panel; variable tracking. See [09 - Dialogue system and Yarn Spinner](../../architecture/09-dialogue-domain-and-yarn-spinner.mdx). **[Impact: Medium]**
4. **GamePlayer** — **MVP-critical.** Playable runtime for Yarn Games. Build in phases: editor tab, load project dialogue, minimal runtime, then character/voice and polish. See [10 - GamePlayer](../../architecture/10-gameplayer.mdx). Prerequisite: Yarn export (or graph load). **[Impact: Medium–Large]**
5. **Plans/capabilities for platform** — **MVP-critical.** **Complete.** CreateListingSheet gates PLATFORM_PUBLISH (status) and PLATFORM_MONETIZE (price); listings beforeChange enforces plan server-side. **[Impact: Small–Medium]**
6. **Platform: monetization (clone / download)** — **MVP-critical.** **Complete.** See [MVP and first revenue](../../product/mvp-and-revenue.mdx). **[Impact: Epic]**
7. **Platform: publish and host builds** — **MVP-critical.** Authors publish project build; we host playable narrative. Build pipeline, storage, playable runtime. See [10 - GamePlayer](../../architecture/10-gameplayer.mdx). **[Impact: Large]**
8. **Apply gates to more surfaces** — Model selection or other surfaces as needed. **Copilot is not gated** (see decisions.md). **[Impact: Small]**
9. **Project-scoped settings** — Add project scope (or scopeId = projectId) to settings-overrides and GET/POST; project-level defaults shared by project members. **[Impact: Medium]**
10. **TRACE.md / before-after benchmark for Codebase Agent Strategy** — Proof-of-effectiveness for downloadable Strategy core; log where agent looks and what it finds (e.g. TRACE.md); benchmark before/after installation. **[Impact: Small–Medium]**

**After MVP**

11. **Editors as MCP Apps** — **After MVP.** Define `McpAppDescriptor` per editor; build Studio MCP Server. See [07 - Editors as MCP Apps](../../architecture/07-modes-as-mcp-apps.mdx). **[Impact: Large]**
12. **Developer program and editor ecosystem** — **After MVP.** Approved editors, data contracts, revenue split while official (no usage-based pay in Studio), publish updates to editor, community vs official apps, MCP Apps for third-party editors, submission (GitHub fork). See [Developer program and editor ecosystem](../../business/developer-program-and-editors.mdx). **[Impact: Epic]**
13. **Marketing site overhaul (Part B)** — **Complete.** Placeholder routes (roadmap, changelog, pricing, demo, privacy, terms); docs content structure and nav; public roadmap and changelog pages; full pricing page; customer admin (sidebar, account/settings, account/billing, account/api-keys); optional login block and Hero “Watch Demo”. Implement as slices 1–8 per plan. **[Impact: Large]****When Video is unlocked (Video not in MVP)**

14. **Twick → VideoDoc persistence + plan/commit UI** — When Video editor is unlocked: map Twick timeline state to our `VideoDoc` draft and connect persistence (save/load); add plan/commit UI for video proposals. **[Impact: Medium]**
15. **Video workflow panel** — When Video editor is unlocked: plan -> patch -> review mirroring Dialogue. **[Impact: Medium]**

**Ongoing**

16. Track any new build warnings in [errors-and-attempts.md](./errors-and-attempts.md).
17. Re-run `pnpm --filter @forge/studio build` after package updates.

**Dev-kit**

18. **Dev-kit single entrypoint and docs** — One package (`@forge/dev-kit`), one style import (bundled dockview + overrides), no dockview in user code. Customer-facing docs (Quick start, Install, First editor, Layout, Styling, API keys, Components/API ref, Editors, Private registry). Internal docs (04, 25, dev-kit-and-keys). Optional create-forge-app CLI. **[Impact: Medium–Large]** See [task-registry](./task-registry.md) initiative `dev-kit-single-entrypoint` and [task-breakdown-dev-kit-single-entrypoint](./task-breakdown-dev-kit-single-entrypoint.md).

**Product roadmap:** [docs/roadmap/](../../roadmap/00-roadmap-index.mdx) - [product.mdx](../../roadmap/product.mdx) for editors and initiatives. **Roadmap remaining:** Full Yarn Spinner implementation (compiler, runtime preview, localization); vision/image input (model registry + chat upload); co-agents (documented, not used). Optional future: agent graphs/subgraphs in runtime. See [architecture/03-copilotkit-and-agents.mdx](../../architecture/03-copilotkit-and-agents.mdx) Section 12.

## What changed (recent)

- **Dockview restored + Video locked**: DockLayout is Dockview-based again (docking + floating panels). Added Dockview slot tabs with containerApi fix, `resetLayout()` recovery, and Dockview CSS imports. Video editor is locked behind capability `studio.video.editor` and documented in ISSUES.md; copilot actions and tabs now hide Video when locked.
- **Marketing site overhaul (Part B)**: Placeholder routes (/roadmap, /changelog, /pricing, /demo, /privacy, /terms); docs content structure (editors, components, ai, yarn-spinner, api-reference, roadmap, changelog); roadmap page with Active/Planned/Shipped; changelog page from STATUS; full pricing page; account layout with sidebar (Overview, Settings, Billing, API Keys); /billing redirects to /account/billing; login page Card layout (login-01 style); Hero “Watch Demo” CTA opening HeroVideoDialog. No testimonials section.
- **User-scoped settings**: Settings-overrides collection has optional `user` relationship. GET `/api/settings` returns only the current user's overrides when authenticated (else global `user: null`). POST sets `user` on create/update. Theme and all app/editor settings persist per user. decisions.md ADR added.
- **Design system styling review**: Token system (four layers, when to use which, file map) and context-aware UI documented in [01-styling-and-theming.mdx](../../design/01-styling-and-theming.mdx). Duplicate `@layer base` removed from studio globals.css. GraphSidebar uses `text-sidebar-foreground` / `bg-sidebar-accent` for contrast. React Flow viewport, default node, and default edge use `--graph-*` tokens in graph.css. ThemeSwitcher dropdown now includes density (Compact / Comfortable); theme and density persist together. [errors-and-attempts.md](./errors-and-attempts.md) "Theme/surface tokens" and [styling-and-ui-consistency.md](./styling-and-ui-consistency.md) reference the token doc.
- **Theme switcher, user in app bar, menu tokens**: Theme switcher in app bar (persisted via settings on select); current user shown (AppBarUser with useMe, or "Not signed in"); dropdown/menu padding driven by theme tokens (`--menu-item-padding-*`, `--menu-content-padding`) in packages/ui and themes.css; app bar layout: project + editors | separator | theme + user + settings. See design/01 and architecture/02.
- **Project switching at app level**: Single `activeProjectId` in app-shell store; `ProjectSwitcher` moved from Dialogue and Character editors into AppShell (editor tab bar). All project-scoped editors share the same project context. See [decisions.md](./decisions.md) (Project context at app level).
- **CopilotKit responses compatibility**: Model registry now tags responses‑v2 compatibility; CopilotKit runtime filters to v2-compatible models with a safe fallback. Assistant‑ui chat uses chat pipeline for broader model support. See errors‑and‑attempts and decisions.
- **CopilotKit runtime sync**: Added `/api/copilotkit/info` catch-all handling so the provider can sync agents; removed the "Agent 'default' not found" runtime error.
- **CopilotKit runtime factory import**: Server routes must import `createForgeCopilotRuntime` from `@forge/shared/copilot/next/runtime` (client index exports provider only).
- **Dialogue Workbench AI surface**: Workbench now hosts the assistant‑ui chat tab, workflow tab, and CopilotKit/assistant devtools tabs. The AI workflow panel was removed from the Inspector and moved into the Workbench to keep workflow UI alongside chat.
- **Styling process and UI fixes**: How-to [26-styling-debugging-with-cursor.mdx](../../how-to/26-styling-debugging-with-cursor.mdx), agent artifact [styling-and-ui-consistency.md](./styling-and-ui-consistency.md), contrast/spacing fixes (toolbar outline buttons, PanelTabs, editor tabs, EditorMenubar, GraphEditorToolbar). After screenshot: [styling_after_contrast_and_spacing.png](../../images/styling_after_contrast_and_spacing.png) (see design/02-components).
- **UI consistency**: Icons on menu items (View/State/File) and editor creation/Workbench buttons; tokenized padding for AI Workflow card; design docs and errors-and-attempts updated with icon/padding rules and screenshot reference.
- **Workspace→Editor API (Option A)**: Workspace* components renamed/moved to Editor*; workspace component export removed from shared index; types re-exported from `@forge/shared` only; all consumers use Editor* and `@forge/shared`; docs and AGENTS updated.
- **Legacy/deprecated cleanup**: Single DockLayout (react-resizable-panels at the time; Dockview restored later); Mode* aliases and workspace-metadata/mode-metadata removed; EditorShell uses only `editorId`; docs and tests use `dialogue` and current component names; .gitignore and agent strategy updated for .tmp (do not edit); production target 2/14 in roadmap.
- **UI modernization**: Design language (Spotify, neobrutal, Rave, shadcn-first); glow/radius/type tokens; Inter font; graph/tab accent styling; icons on panels and editor tabs; enhanced-features backlog; DockLayout (react-resizable-panels at the time, now Dockview); all editors use DockLayout (layout persists to localStorage).
- **Payload SQLite CANTOPEN fix**: Default DB path is now resolved from `payload.config.ts` location (`apps/studio/data/payload.db`); `data` dir is created when `DATABASE_URI` is unset. Documented in [errors-and-attempts.md](./errors-and-attempts.md).
- **Docs and MCP roadmap overhaul**: 3 new architecture docs (Editors as MCP Apps, CopilotKit vs assistant-ui, Dialogue system and Yarn Spinner). Product roadmap expanded with MCP Apps and Yarn Spinner initiatives. Project overview reframed as interactive narrative storytelling engine.
- **Editor migration complete**: All editors (Dialogue, Video, Character, Strategy) use EditorShell + DockLayout. Legacy workspace directory removed. Naming standardized to "editor" for top-level units and "mode" for in-editor state.
- **assistant-ui + tool-ui integrated**: CodebaseAgentStrategyEditor in shared package. Thread, ThreadList, ToolFallback, ToolGroup components. 25+ tool-ui components (approval-card, terminal, plan, code-block, etc.).
- Studio app moved to `apps/studio` and workspace packages to `packages/*`, including new `packages/ui` for shared shadcn atoms.
- Payload types now flow from the app config into a shared `packages/types` package.
- Studio build succeeds; Payload emits a known dynamic import warning (documented in [errors-and-attempts.md](./errors-and-attempts.md)).
- CopilotKit runtime uses OpenAI + @ai-sdk/openai with OpenRouter baseURL; provider stack (OpenRouter / ElevenLabs / Sora) documented in 06 and decisions.
