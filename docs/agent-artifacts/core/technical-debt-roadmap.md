# Technical debt roadmap

For **"what's next for technical debt,"** pick an open item below. When done, add a Ralph Wiggum Done line in [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md) and set the item to `done` here.

**Process:** Add items from [errors-and-attempts.md](./errors-and-attempts.md) follow-ups, [decisions.md](./decisions.md) ("Tech debt: …"), production checklist, or when someone identifies debt. Pre-production items are for before (or right after) going to production; Ongoing is refactors and cleanup when we have capacity. When you start an item, set status to `in_progress` in this file. When sections grow, compact per [compacting-and-archiving.md](./compacting-and-archiving.md).
