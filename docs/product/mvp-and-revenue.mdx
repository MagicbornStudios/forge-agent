# MVP and first revenue

Product and monetization. See [roadmap/product](../roadmap/product) and [STATUS](../agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md).

## Product stance

- **Narrative first** — structure of a book, then interactivity.
- **Start with dialogue** — backbone of interactive narrative.
- **AI-first, thin engine** — content in our system; scale to AAA via Yarn/Unity/Unreal/Godot.

## MVP definition

- **Success** = first paid clone E2E.
- **Paid clone/download** — first revenue mechanism.
- **Catalog** — users and orgs browse/list; creators list from day one.
- **Stripe Connect** — payouts for creators.

## MVP editors

**In MVP:** Dialogue, Character, Writer, GamePlayer.  
**Not in MVP:** Video (locked), Strategy editor (ships after).
