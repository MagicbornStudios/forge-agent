# MVP and first revenue

Product and monetization strategy for the Studio platform. **We focus on funding quickly while delivering clear value.** See [product roadmap](../roadmap/product.mdx) for editor and initiative details, and [STATUS](../agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md) for current state and next steps.

---

## First revenue: paid clone / download

Our **first revenue mechanism** is **paid clone or download** (not publish/host or seats first).

- Users can **clone** a project, template, or “core” (e.g. Codebase Agent Strategy) to their account for a price.
- Or **download** a build or integration package for a price.
- Listings, checkout, and payouts (e.g. Stripe Connect) are in scope; plan tiers and capabilities gate who can list and who can clone/download paid items.

**Plans/capabilities:** We extend `user.plan` and `CAPABILITIES` (e.g. `PLATFORM_MONETIZE`) to gate platform features. Copilot remains free; monetization and listing are gated.

## MVP: two hero moments

MVP is the smallest slice that (1) delivers clear value and (2) ties to first revenue (paid clone/download). We have **two hero paths**; both lead to the same monetization.

### Path A — Author a small game fully with AI

- Use Studio (Dialogue + Character + Strategy + AI) to **author a complete small game** (narrative/content).
- Value: writers, narrative teams, and indies ship a playable thing without building the engine.
- Monetization: **clone** a starter or **download** a build/template for a price.

### Path B — Layer Studio on existing projects

- Use Studio to **create content** (dialogue, narrative, characters) for games that already exist.
- **Install “our core”** = **Codebase Agent Strategy** — optimal codebase management and feature implementation for humans and codebases (Strategy editor + assistant-ui + tool-ui).
- Value: indies and AAA get narrative content authoring plus a **coding-agent layer** for their repo (feature work, agent-driven dev).
- Monetization: **clone** the strategy workspace or **download** the core/integration for a price.

MVP = ship one or both paths with **paid clone/download** and plan tiers so we can gate and charge.

## Audience

| Segment | What they get |
|--------|----------------|
| **Writers** | Narrative/dialogue authoring with AI; ship or sell content. |
| **Game content / narrative teams** | Dialogue and character graphs, Yarn-compatible workflows, collaboration. |
| **Indie game devs** | Author a small game with AI, or add content + Codebase Agent Strategy to existing projects. |
| **AAA (prototype / enhance)** | Prototype narrative; enhance coding agents and analytics for more ambitious games. |

---

## Positioning

- **We are a game/narrative content authoring engine, AI- and chat-first.**
- **Thin game engine** — we are not a full game engine; we are the **content + agent layer**.
- Authors build dialogue, characters, and narrative; they can run small playable experiences or plug our core (Strategy) into existing codebases for agent-driven development.

---

## Video editor: locked until after MVP

The Video editor (Twick timeline) is **locked** behind capability `studio.video.editor` and is **not** part of MVP.

- Unlock **after** MVP (after paid clone/download and plan tiers are live).
- See [ISSUES.md](../../ISSUES.md) and [plan-dockview-restore-video-lock-feature-flags.md](../agent-artifacts/core/plan-dockview-restore-video-lock-feature-flags.md).

---

## Evolution (high level)

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|--------|
| **Now** | Studio + Dialogue (primary), Character, Strategy; Video locked. No paid flows. |
| **MVP** | Two hero moments (small game with AI **or** content + Strategy core on existing projects); **paid clone/download**; plan tiers/capabilities. |
| **After MVP** | Video unlock; publish/host if needed; more editors/MCP; expand listings and payouts. |
| **Dream** | Full content authoring platform + Strategy core everywhere; writers, indies, AAA; clone/download and optional host/distribute. |
