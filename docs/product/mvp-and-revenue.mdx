# MVP and first revenue

Product and monetization strategy for the Studio platform. **We focus on funding quickly while delivering clear value.** See [product roadmap](../roadmap/product.mdx) for editor and initiative details, and [STATUS](../agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md) for current state and next steps.

---

## MVP definition of done

- **MVP success criterion** = **first paid clone completed end-to-end**.
- **One end-to-end clone/download** — cloneable project or template is the first paid product; one full flow shipped.
- **Paid and free plan tiers** — required at MVP; capabilities gate who can list and who can clone/download paid items.
- **Catalog at MVP** — users and orgs can browse and list (catalog for users and orgs).
- **Creators list from day one** — catalog at MVP includes creator listings from day one; Stripe Connect (or similar) and payouts required so creators can list and get paid.

---

## First revenue: paid clone / download

Our **first revenue mechanism** is **paid clone or download** (not publish/host or seats first).

- **First thing they can pay for:** a **cloneable project or template**.
- Users can **clone** a project, template, or “core” (e.g. Codebase Agent Strategy) to their account for a price.
- Or **download** a build or integration package for a price.
- Listings, checkout, and payouts (e.g. Stripe Connect) are in scope; plan tiers and capabilities gate who can list and who can clone/download paid items.

**Plans/capabilities:** We extend `user.plan` and `CAPABILITIES` (e.g. `PLATFORM_MONETIZE`) to gate platform features. Copilot remains free; monetization and listing are gated.

---

## Revenue model

**Both platform and creator get paid** (Unity Asset Store / Bandlab model). Presets and packages; we take a cut; creators get payouts (Stripe Connect or similar). Catalog supports users and orgs.

---

## Clone semantics

When a user **pays to clone**:

- They get **access to that project indefinitely**.
- They can **clone it as many times as they want** (no per-clone fee after purchase).
- The **data/game can be different versions at the time of each clone** — each clone is a version snapshot at clone time.

---

## Yarn export in MVP

**Yarn Spinner export (e.g. `.yarn` export) is in MVP**, not deferred. Needed for narrative games and the scale-to-AAA story (Unity, Unreal, Godot).

---

## Users and API keys

- **Standard users** (no API key concept): use **our cloud Studio**; a **subscription** covers AI usage; they author heavily on our infra.
- **Advanced users**: first-class **OpenRouter**; optional **ELEVENLABS_API_KEY** and **OpenAPI key for Sora** for full media (voice, video).
- **MVP users** = **Studio in the cloud** — no requirement to bring API keys for the standard tier. See [Dev-kit and API keys](dev-kit-and-keys.mdx).

---

## Strategy definition

**Codebase Agent Strategy** = our **core docs** (agent-artifacts, decisions, STATUS, etc.) **plus AGENTS.md** files in the codebase. The Strategy editor (in-app) is **docs + analysis** of those docs and agent artifacts.

- We **provide the core** for users to **download**.
- **TRACE** (e.g. log where you look and what you found in TRACE.md) is part of **MVP for the Strategy (downloadable core)** — to prove effectiveness when users install the core. TRACE is **not** part of MVP for the Studio app or the marketing platform.
- As we update core, we can **benchmark before/after** installation to prove effectiveness.
- **Strategy is literally the entirety of core + AGENTS.md.**

---

## Writer editor (for writers)

Notion-like editor based on **Facebook Lexical**. Write normally; **branching narrative** (different takes) in the project. **Interactive narrative, choices, dialogue** with AI assistance and **graphing**. **Yarn Spinner** as formalized dialogue (Unity/Unreal/Godot); narrative can **scale to AAA** when they outgrow our thin engine. We keep their content; we generate media and guide with graphs + AI. **Thin engine produces “Yarn Games”** (simple, opinionated). The downloadable Strategy core helps them get a more productive agent for building complex games in Unreal/Unity/Godot.

---

## MVP editors (Studio)

**In MVP:** **Dialogue**, **Character**, **Writer**, **GamePlayer**.

- **GamePlayer** — playable runtime for Yarn Games (thin engine); authors build in Dialogue/Character/Writer, then play in GamePlayer. Documented as MVP editor; implementation to be built.
- **Video** and **Strategy (codebase) editor** are **not** in MVP. Video is locked until after MVP; the in-app CodebaseAgentStrategyEditor is out of scope for MVP. The **downloadable Strategy core** (docs + AGENTS.md) and TRACE (for proof) remain in scope; the Strategy editor in Studio ships after MVP.

---

## MVP infrastructure and platform

- **MVP infra** = we run **Vercel + Payload** (Studio in the cloud). No self-host requirement for MVP.
- **Platform** = our **marketing site** is the **landing page and platform** (account, catalog, billing, “Open Studio”). We can change this later if we split platform into a separate app.

---

## MVP: two hero moments

MVP is the smallest slice that (1) delivers clear value and (2) ties to first revenue (paid clone/download). We have **two hero paths**; both lead to the same monetization.

### Path A — Author a small game fully with AI

- Use Studio (Dialogue + Character + Writer + GamePlayer + AI) to **author a complete small game** (narrative/content).
- Value: writers, narrative teams, and indies ship a playable thing without building the engine.
- Monetization: **clone** a starter or **download** a build/template for a price.

### Path B — Layer Studio on existing projects

- Use Studio to **create content** (dialogue, narrative, characters) for games that already exist.
- **Download** our **Codebase Agent Strategy core** (docs + AGENTS.md) for agent productivity. Strategy *editor* in Studio ships after MVP.
- Value: indies and AAA get narrative content authoring plus our downloadable core for their repo (feature work, agent-driven dev).
- Monetization: **clone** a template or **download** the Strategy core/integration for a price.

MVP = ship one or both paths with **paid clone/download**, **catalog**, **creators list from day one**, and **paid + free** plan tiers.

---

## MVP technical bar

- **Simple game** built on our graphs.
- **All image, audio, and generation** up and running.
- **All AI** must be working in editors; expectation is **users never need to use an editor by hand** (AI-first); editor is there as fallback.

---

## Audience

| Segment | What they get |
|--------|----------------|
| **Writers** | Narrative/dialogue authoring with AI; Writer editor (Lexical, branching); ship or sell content; Yarn Games. |
| **Game content / narrative teams** | Dialogue and character graphs, Yarn-compatible workflows, collaboration. |
| **Indie game devs** | Author a small game with AI, or add content + Codebase Agent Strategy to existing projects. |
| **AAA (prototype / enhance)** | Prototype narrative; enhance coding agents and analytics for more ambitious games. |

---

## Positioning

- **We are a game/narrative content authoring engine, AI- and chat-first.**
- **Thin game engine** — we are not a full game engine; we are the **content + agent layer**.
- Authors build dialogue, characters, and narrative; they can run small playable experiences (Yarn Games) or plug our core (Strategy) into existing codebases for agent-driven development.

---

## Video editor: locked until after MVP

The Video editor (Twick timeline) is **locked** behind capability `studio.video.editor` and is **not** part of MVP.

- Unlock **after** MVP (after paid clone/download and plan tiers are live).
- See [ISSUES.md](../../ISSUES.md) and [plan-dockview-restore-video-lock-feature-flags.md](../agent-artifacts/core/plan-dockview-restore-video-lock-feature-flags.md).

---

## Strategy (codebase) editor: not in MVP

The in-app **Strategy editor** (CodebaseAgentStrategyEditor) is **out of scope for MVP**. The **downloadable Strategy core** (docs + AGENTS.md) and **TRACE** (for proof) are in scope; the Strategy editor in Studio ships after MVP.

---

## Evolution (high level)

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|--------|
| **Now** | Studio + Dialogue (primary), Character, Strategy; Video locked. No paid flows. |
| **MVP** | **Editors:** Dialogue, Character, Writer, GamePlayer. Video and Strategy editor not in MVP. One end-to-end clone/download; **success** = first paid clone E2E; **creators list from day one**; **Yarn export**; **catalog** (users + orgs); **paid + free tiers**; **revenue share** (platform + creator); **clone semantics**; **Vercel + Payload**; **platform** = marketing site. TRACE for Strategy (downloadable core) only. |
| **After MVP** | Video unlock; Strategy editor in Studio; publish/host if needed; more editors/MCP; expand listings and payouts. |
| **Dream** | Full content authoring platform + Strategy core everywhere; writers, indies, AAA; clone/download and optional host/distribute. |
