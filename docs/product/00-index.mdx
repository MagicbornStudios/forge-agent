# Product and strategy

## What is Forge?

Forge is an **AI-first studio for interactive narrative**. Creators use Studio to author dialogue and character graphs; the Platform provides docs and marketplace content. Editors are built from shared primitives (EditorShell, EditorDockLayout, Assistant UI).

## Personas

| Persona | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Creator** | Studio — Dialogue, Character, Video editors. Graph authoring, AI assistant. |
| **Developer** | Dev-kit, API keys, self-host or cloud. Extend editors and integrate AI. |
| **Customer** | Platform — Docs, marketing, product discovery. |

See [Studio vs Platform](../guides/studio-vs-platform.mdx) for how the two apps work together.

## Docs

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| [MVP and first revenue](mvp-and-revenue) | First paid clone, MVP hero moments, audience |
| [Dev-kit and keys](dev-kit-and-keys) | How users use dev-kit; API keys; cloud subscription |
