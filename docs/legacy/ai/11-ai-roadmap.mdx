## Dependencies & Risks

### External Dependencies

| Dependency | Risk | Mitigation |
|------------|------|------------|
| OpenRouter uptime | High | Multi-provider fallback |
| Model availability | Medium | Cached model registry, fallbacks |
| ElevenLabs API | Medium | Alternative TTS providers |
| Anthropic caching API | Low | Graceful degradation to non-cached |

### Technical Debt

- CopilotKit removal (Phase 1) — 2 weeks effort
- Model registry refactor for multimodal (Phase 3) — 1 week
- Zustand store migration for multi-agent (Phase 3) — 1 week

### Resource Constraints

- **Compute:** OpenRouter credits ($500/month budget Q1 → $2000/month Q2)
- **Engineering:** 1 FTE on AI infrastructure
- **Design:** UX for model selection, cost visibility
