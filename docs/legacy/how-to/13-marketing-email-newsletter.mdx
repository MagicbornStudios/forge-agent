# 13 - Platform email / newsletter

Minimal newsletter pipeline for platform pages.

## Storage

- Subscribers are stored in Payload `newsletter-subscribers`.
- Platform form posts to Studio `POST /api/newsletter`.

## Optional Resend welcome email

- **Env (Studio):** `RESEND_API_KEY` and optional `FROM_EMAIL`.
- After subscriber creation, Studio can send a welcome email through Resend.
- If email send fails, API still returns success because subscriber data is already stored.

## Waitlist

- Platform waitlist page posts to `POST /api/waitlist`.
- Data is stored in Payload `waitlist` collection.
