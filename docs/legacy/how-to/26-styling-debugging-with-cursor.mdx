# 26 – Styling debugging with Cursor

Tutorial-style guide for fixing styling issues in this codebase using Cursor, browser selectors, screenshots, and plans. Use this workflow when debugging or updating UI so humans and agents stay consistent.

## Context

Our editor UI is complex: DockLayout panels, toolbars (File/View/State, Admin, API, Workbench), panel tabs (Narratives, Storylets, Nodes), and inspector cards. Styling is driven by:

- **Design tokens** and shared components — [01 - Styling and theming](../design/01-styling-and-theming.mdx), [02 - Components](../design/02-components.mdx).
- **Theme and density** — `data-theme`, `data-density`, and tokens like `--panel-padding`, `--control-gap`, `--tab-height`.

Before changing styles, read the design docs and [agent-artifacts/core/styling-and-ui-consistency.md](../agent-artifacts/core/styling-and-ui-consistency.md).

## Workflow (human and agent)

### Preflight: verify CSS pipeline

1. Run `pnpm css:doctor` from repo root before opening the browser.
2. If it fails, fix the reported `globals.css` or generated utility probes first.
3. Re-run `pnpm css:doctor` until it passes; then start visual debugging.

### Before: capture the problem

1. In Cursor, use the browser (or embedded preview) to select the problematic elements.
2. Copy into chat:
   - **DOM path** and **position** (e.g. from Cursor’s element picker).
   - **React component** and **HTML element** when available.
3. Attach a **screenshot** (e.g. "before" or "half-done" state).
4. Save reference screenshots under **docs/images/** with descriptive names (e.g. `buttons_dropdowns_menutitems_unstyled.png`, `half_done_buttons.png`). Reference them in design or how-to docs so we have a visible "avoid" or "before" reference.

### Plans: scope and track

- Create a plan (or use an existing plan file) so changes are scoped and tracked.
- Implement in slices; update STATUS and relevant docs after each slice.

### After: document the outcome (optional; humans)

- When UI/styling changes are done, an **after** screenshot is optional. **Do not use automated browser screenshot tools**—they error too often. If you want a visual reference, **humans** should: run the app, take a screenshot (Cursor browser tools or any screenshot tool), save to **docs/images/** with a descriptive name (e.g. `styling_after_contrast_and_spacing.png`), and add a short reference in the relevant doc or plan/changelog.

## Agent instructions

When making UI/styling changes as part of a styling or debugging pass:

1. **Before:** If there is an existing "before" screenshot, keep it; do not overwrite it.
2. **Implement:** Use design tokens and patterns from design/01 and 02; follow [styling-and-ui-consistency.md](../agent-artifacts/core/styling-and-ui-consistency.md).
3. **After:** Do **not** run browser screenshot automation (it errors too often). Update design docs and STATUS. If an "after" screenshot is needed, note in STATUS that a human can capture and save to `docs/images/<descriptive_name>.png` and reference it in the doc or STATUS.
4. **Docs:** Update design docs or errors-and-attempts when new patterns or fixes are introduced.
