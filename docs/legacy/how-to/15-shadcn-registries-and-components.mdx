# 15 - Shadcn registries and UI components

How we use shadcn `components.json`, where to add registries, and where generated components should live.

## components.json ownership

`components.json` is per-project. The CLI installs components into the current project directory.

| Location | Role | Registries |
|----------|------|------------|
| `packages/ui` | Shared atoms and shared registry components published as `@forge/ui` | `@lucide-animated`, `@billingsdk` |
| `apps/studio` | Studio-only components | (none currently) |
| `apps/platform` | Platform-only customer UI (landing/docs/account/catalog) | platform app registries as needed |

## Rule of thumb

- Shared across apps/consumers -> install in `packages/ui`.
- Only used by Studio -> install in `apps/studio`.
- Only used by platform -> install in `apps/platform`.

## Adding a registry

```bash
cd packages/ui
# or: cd apps/studio
# or: cd apps/platform
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest registry add @namespace
```

## Installing a component from a registry

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @namespace/component-name
```

Examples:

- Shared atom/component: run in `packages/ui`, then export from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`.
- Platform-only UI: run in `apps/platform`.

## Summary matrix

| Goal | Use this `components.json` | Installed component location |
|------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Shared UI atom or shared registry component | `packages/ui` | `packages/ui/src/components/ui/*` |
| Studio-only component | `apps/studio` | `apps/studio/components/*` |
| Platform-only component | `apps/platform` | `apps/platform/src/components/*` |
