# Tools, Editors, and Systems

We align Forge Agent's product language with Unreal Engine's terminology:

- **Tools** are specific task affordances (place nodes, paint terrain, inspect properties).
- **Editors** are collections of tools for a complex outcome (Dialogue Editor, Video Editor).
- **Systems** are underlying capabilities and domain packages (Dialogue system, Video system).

This keeps UI, code, and documentation consistent with Unreal's mental model and makes
it easier to reason about feature scope.

## Mapping table (Old -> New)

| Legacy term | New term | Meaning in Forge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Workspace** / **Mode** (top-level) | **Editor** | Switchable top-level unit (Dialogue, Video, Character, Strategy). |
| **Editor** (viewport scope) | **Viewport** | The primary surface inside an editor (React Flow, Twick, Lexical). |
| **Domain package** | **System** | Implementation packages like `domain-forge`, `domain-video`. |
| **Toolbar items / panels** | **Tools** | Actions and panels inside an editor. |

**Rule:** "Mode" is now reserved for **in-editor state** (select/paint/inspect),
not for top-level units.

---

## Code-level alignment

| Area | Unreal term | Forge implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App container | Editor host | `WorkspaceApp` + `AppShell` tabs |
| Editor root | Editor | `WorkspaceShell` |
| Tool surfaces | Tools | `WorkspaceHeader`, `WorkspaceToolbar`, `DockPanel`, `PanelTabs` |
| Viewport | Viewport | `DockLayout` + `ViewportMeta` (`data-viewport-*`) |
| Systems | Systems | `packages/domain-*` |

---

## Example: Dialogue Editor

- **Editor:** Dialogue Editor (`WorkspaceShell` with `domain="dialogue"`).
- **Tools:** node palette, minimap, inspector, AI plan review bar.
- **Viewport:** React Flow graph surface (`ViewportMeta` with `viewportType="react-flow"`).
- **System:** `packages/domain-forge` (graph model, operations, copilot contracts).
- **Modes (internal state):** select, connect, paint, inspect.

---

## Naming rules for new work

- Use **Editor** for top-level units (Dialogue Editor, Video Editor).
- Use **Viewport** for the main surface inside an editor.
- Use **System** for domain packages.
- Use **Mode** only for transient in-editor states or tools.
