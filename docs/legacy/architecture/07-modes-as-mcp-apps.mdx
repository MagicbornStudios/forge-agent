# Editors as MCP Apps

Each editor in Studio can be exposed as an **MCP App** — a self-contained
unit that an external MCP host (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, or another
MCP-aware client) can embed or orchestrate. **Studio itself** also exposes
**app-level** MCP tools (publish, switch editor, project context) so the
platform can be driven entirely from chat. See [11 - MCP vs CopilotKit and assistant-ui](11-mcp-copilotkit-assistant-ui.mdx) for caveats and [12 - MCP hosts and chat-first](12-mcp-hosts-and-chat-first.mdx) for host setup.

## Studio app-level MCP

Studio exposes **app tools** (not just editor tools) so any MCP host can drive
the app from chat without opening the Studio UI:

| Tool | Purpose | Current implementation |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| `studio_switchEditor` | Switch active editor tab | [AppShell.tsx](../../apps/studio/components/AppShell.tsx) — `useCopilotAction` with `createAppAction` |
| `studio_openEditor` | Open an editor (add tab) | Same |
| `studio_closeEditor` | Close an editor tab | Same |
| `studio_getProject` | Get current project context | App shell store `activeProjectId`; project APIs |
| `studio_listProjects` | List user's projects | Payload projects collection / API |
| `studio_publish` | Create listing from current project | [CreateListingSheet](../../apps/studio/components/listings/CreateListingSheet.tsx), [useCreateListing](../../apps/studio/lib/data/hooks/use-listings.ts) |
| `studio_updateListing` | Update existing listing for current project | Same listing APIs; project ↔ listing link |

When invoked by an **external** MCP host (e.g. Cursor, Claude Desktop), these
tools may run in a **headless** or **hosted** Studio context. That implies
session/auth and state: the MCP server must resolve identity and "current
project" (e.g. via API token, or when Studio is running locally and the
host talks to it). See [11 - MCP vs CopilotKit and assistant-ui](11-mcp-copilotkit-assistant-ui.mdx) for auth and two control planes.

## Editor registration with Studio

When a **new editor** is added, it **comes with an MCP**: it exports an
`McpAppDescriptor` (id, name, tools, uiResources) and **registers** with
Studio so the Studio MCP Server can:

- Discover and advertise that editor's tools.
- Route tool invocations to the correct domain logic.
- Serve UI resources for hosts that support them.

**Registration contract:** Descriptors are registered in a registry (app shell
or MCP server process). The Studio MCP Server aggregates all registered
editors and exposes a single tool surface to hosts. This aligns with the
existing editor list (Dialogue, Character, Video, Strategy) in
[AppShell](../../apps/studio/components/AppShell.tsx) and
[editor metadata](../../packages/shared/src/shared/components/editor/README.md).
**Third-party and community** editors (see [Developer program and editor ecosystem](../business/developer-program-and-editors.mdx)) implement the same contract so they can register and be exposed alongside built-in editors.

---

## What is an MCP App?

An MCP App bundles two things:

1. **Tools** — functions the host agent can invoke (create node, run plan,
   query graph state, etc.).
2. **UI Resources** — React component trees the host can render in its own
   surface (panel, sidebar, overlay).

The MCP protocol handles discovery, invocation, and streaming; Studio provides
the implementations.

## Architecture

```
MCP Host (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, Atlas, Perplexity, browser)
  │
  ├── discovers tools via MCP registry
  │
  ├── invokes tools ──► Studio MCP Server
  │                         ├── App tools: studio_switchEditor, studio_openEditor,
  │                         │   studio_closeEditor, studio_getProject, studio_listProjects,
  │                         │   studio_publish, studio_updateListing
  │                         ├── Registered editor tools: DialogueApp, CharacterApp,
  │                         │   VideoApp, StrategyApp (each from McpAppDescriptor)
  │                         └── → Studio backend / domain logic
  │
  └── renders UI resources ──► React component trees (when host supports them)

Two consumers of the same tool backend:
  • Studio UI (in-browser) — CopilotKit + assistant-ui call domain logic.
  • External chat — MCP host calls Studio MCP Server → same domain logic.
```

### Studio MCP Server

A lightweight server (Node or edge) that:

- Exposes **app tools** (studio_switchEditor, studio_publish, etc.) and
  **registered editor tools** (from each editor's McpAppDescriptor).
- Aggregates editor descriptors from the registration registry.
- Handles tool invocations by delegating to Studio backend / domain logic.
- Serves UI resources as serialized component descriptors.

### Per-editor app descriptor

Each editor exports an `McpAppDescriptor`:

```ts
interface McpAppDescriptor {
  id: string;              // e.g. 'dialogue', 'character'
  name: string;            // human-readable
  tools: McpToolDef[];     // tool definitions
  uiResources: McpUiResource[];  // component descriptors
}
```

## Editor → MCP App mapping

| Editor | MCP App ID | Tools | UI Resources |
|------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Dialogue | `dialogue` | createNode, updateNode, deleteNode, getGraph, runPlan | Graph editor, node palette, plan review |
| Character | `character` | createElement, updateElement, createLink, getGraph | Character graph, relationship inspector |
| Video | `video` | addTrack, updateElement, getTimeline | Timeline surface, track list |
| Strategy | `strategy` | sendMessage, getThreads, runTool | Chat thread, tool activity feed |

---

## Embedding editors externally

A consumer app can embed an editor in two ways:

### 1. Full component embed

Import the editor component from `@forge/shared` or `@forge/dev-kit` and render
it directly:

```tsx
import { CodebaseAgentStrategyEditor } from '@forge/dev-kit';

<CodebaseAgentStrategyEditor apiUrl="/api/assistant-chat" />
```

### 2. MCP tool + resource embed

The MCP host discovers the editor's tools and UI resources, then renders them in
its own surface. The host calls tools to drive behavior and displays the UI
resource for visual feedback.

## Third-party and community editors as MCP Apps

**Third-party approved** and **community** editors implement the same MCP App contract (`McpAppDescriptor`, tools, UI resources) as our built-in editors. They can be embedded in Studio and in external MCP hosts. Approval and listing (community vs official, payouts) are business concerns; see [Developer program and editor ecosystem](../business/developer-program-and-editors.mdx).

---

## Roadmap

| Phase | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| **Now** | Editors work as in-app tabs within Studio. Consumer example uses component embed. |
| **Next** | Define `McpAppDescriptor` per editor. Build Studio MCP Server. |
| **Later** | Register with MCP hosts. Streaming tool results. Cross-editor orchestration. |
