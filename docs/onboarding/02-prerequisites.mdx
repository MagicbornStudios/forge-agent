# Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Node 20+** — Run `node -v` to check
- **pnpm 9+** — Run `pnpm -v` to check. If needed: `npm install -g pnpm`

## Optional but useful

- **Git** — For cloning and contributing
- **A code editor** — Cursor, VS Code, or similar

That's it. Next: install and env.
