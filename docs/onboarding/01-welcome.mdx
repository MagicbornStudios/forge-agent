# Welcome to Forge

Forge is an **AI-first studio** for interactive narrative: Dialogue and Character editors, clean editor primitives, and Assistant UI + LangGraph. You can build your own workspace, ship it, and contribute it back.

## What you'll get

- **Studio UI** — Project switcher, Dialogue and Character editors, Inspector, Chat panel
- **Editor platform** — `WorkspaceShell`, `WorkspaceLayout`, `WorkspacePanel` and design tokens from `@forge/shared`
- **AI in context** — Assistant UI with domain contracts; LangGraph orchestration (in progress)

## Where to start

Work through this onboarding in order: **02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06**. You'll install, configure env, run Studio, see what's there, and know where to go next.
