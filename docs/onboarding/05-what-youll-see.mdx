# What you'll see

When Studio is running, you'll see the expected first-run UI:

## Studio UI

- **Project switcher** — Top-left; switch or create projects
- **Editor tabs** — Dialogue, Character (and others when enabled)
- **Main area** — Active editor (graph, timeline, inspector content)
- **Right rail** — Inspector (selection properties) and Chat (Assistant UI)
- **Docs** — In-app docs at [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs): how-tos, architecture, AI. Browse all components at [Components Showcase](components/showcase/atoms.mdx).

## Editors

- **Dialogue** — Dual narrative/storylet graphs per project; React Flow; AI plan-execute-review-commit
- **Character** — Relationship graph, drag-drop characters, AI assistant
- **Video** (locked) — Timeline UI; not MVP
- **Strategy** (locked) — Codebase agent; not MVP

## Key files

- `apps/studio/components/Studio.tsx` — Root component; registries for editors, menus, panels
- `apps/studio/registry/__index__.tsx` — Default editor registration
- `packages/shared/src/shared/components/editor/` — EditorShell, DockLayout, DockPanel

Do not: Add editor tabs manually in AppShell; use registry. Do not assume Video or Strategy are enabled
