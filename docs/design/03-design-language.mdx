# Design language

One-pager for the editor’s visual direction: professional, modern, elegant, with a Spotify-intense, neobrutal dark feel and Rave-like glows. We aim to look **much more shadcn** than before while keeping density where it matters.

## 1. Spotify-intense

- **Dark sidebar and canvas** — Clear hierarchy between navigation, content, and inspector.
- **One primary accent** — Green/teal (or domain accent) used sparingly: active state, primary actions, selection. No visual clutter.
- **Clean cards and lists** — Clear hierarchy; muted borders; purposeful use of `bg-card`, `border-border`, and semantic tokens.
- **High-contrast** — Text and controls readable; deliberate contrast between levels (background, card, muted).

## 2. Neobrutal but dark

- **Bold where it matters** — Strong type for headings and primary labels; confident, not soft.
- **Deliberate borders** — 1px or 2px borders; high contrast; optional thick accent (e.g. left edge of selected item, top bar of active panel).
- **Dark base, bright accents** — Dark backgrounds with clear structure; accents (green/teal, domain colors) pop without feeling garish.
- **Not soft/fluffy** — We avoid marketing-soft; we stay tool-like and professional.

## 3. Rave / glows

- **Glows on focus and selection** — Use `--context-glow` and `--glow-*` tokens for: focus rings (soft glow), selected graph nodes, timeline playhead, active tab or panel accent, hover on key controls.
- **Premium, not garish** — Glows should feel alive and polished; keep opacity and spread subtle so they enhance rather than overwhelm.
- **Where to apply** — Focused inputs/dropdowns; selected nodes; ForgeGraphPanel when focused (top bar); active tab (underline or top bar + optional glow); DockPanel headers when active.

## 4. Shadcn-first

- **Align with shadcn defaults** — Prefer shadcn’s typical radius and focus behavior where we haven’t over-tightened. Our atoms in `packages/ui` should look like shadcn docs: rounded, clear focus ring, readable type.
- **Audit over-tightening** — We previously forced 11px/10px and tiny radius in many places. Relax to 12px for labels and slightly larger radius so we "look more shadcn."
- **Compact via data-density** — Support compact density via `data-density="compact"` for power users; default appearance aligns with shadcn for elegance.

## 5. Professional and elegant

- **Consistent spacing** — Use tokens only (`--panel-padding`, `--control-gap`, etc.); no ad-hoc `px-*`/`py-*` in editor chrome.
- **Consistent icon set** — Lucide React throughout; standard size (e.g. 16px) and style (outline). Menu items and toolbar actions must include an icon where the action benefits from visual recognition (e.g. Fit view, Open workbench, Save, editor creation buttons).
- **Semantic tokens only** — No hardcoded colors; use `--background`, `--foreground`, `--border`, `--context-accent`, `--glow-*`, etc.

## Relation to other design docs

- **Density and tokens** — Still defined in [01 - Styling and theming](01-styling-and-theming.mdx). This doc replaces "Sharpness over softness" as the primary visual direction while keeping density tokens.
- **Components** — [02 - Components](02-components.mdx) lists atoms and molecules; they should adhere to this language (glows, radius, type scale).
