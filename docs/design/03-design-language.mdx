# Design language

One-pager for the editor’s visual direction: professional, modern, elegant — **technical and powerful**, with clear hierarchy and shadcn-first UI. We aim to look **much more shadcn** than before while keeping density where it matters.

## 1. Technical and powerful

- **Clear hierarchy** — Navigation, content, and inspector are distinct; one primary accent used sparingly (active state, primary actions, selection). No visual clutter.
- **Shadcn-first** — Prefer shadcn UI (Button, Label, Menubar, Tabs, etc.) for all editor chrome; avoid plain HTML elements unless necessary.
- **Text and icons within containers** — Truncation, `min-w-0`, and constrained layout so text and icons stay inside their containers (no overflow).
- **Accent bordering: one edge only** — For list items, cards, and tab-like surfaces, use accent on **one edge only** (top, or one side, or bottom). **No full border** (no four-sided purple/primary border) for narrative graph list items or similar.

## 2. Spotify-inspired (two themes only)

- **Themes** — Only **light** and **dark**; Spotify-based palettes (dark: near-black background, light text, green accent; light: white/light gray, dark text, same green accent).
- **Dark sidebar and canvas** — Clear hierarchy between navigation, content, and inspector.
- **One primary accent** — Green (e.g. `#1DB954`-like) used sparingly: active state, primary actions, selection. No visual clutter.
- **Radius** — Modest, Spotify-like (4–8px for controls and cards); see `--radius-*` in themes.css.
- **Clean cards and lists** — Clear hierarchy; muted borders; purposeful use of `bg-card`, `border-border`, and semantic tokens.
- **High-contrast** — Text and controls readable; deliberate contrast between levels (background, card, muted).

## 3. Deliberate borders (no full-border selection)

- **Single-edge accent** — Selected list items, active panel, active tab: use left edge, top edge, or bottom edge (e.g. `border-l-2 border-primary`), not a full box.
- **Dark base, bright accents** — Dark backgrounds with clear structure; accents pop without feeling garish. Tool-like and professional.

## 4. Focus and selection (subtle, not heavy)

- **Focus and selection** — Use `--glow-focus` and `--glow-selection` for a clear 2px ring; no large blur or spread. Panel and tab active state use **border or accent line** (e.g. bottom edge), not glowing box-shadow.
- **Where to apply** — Focused inputs/dropdowns; selected nodes (border or outline); active tab (underline or bottom border); DockPanel headers when active (border accent).

## 5. Shadcn-first

- **Align with shadcn defaults** — Prefer shadcn’s typical radius and focus behavior where we haven’t over-tightened. Our atoms in `packages/ui` should look like shadcn docs: rounded, clear focus ring, readable type.
- **Audit over-tightening** — We previously forced 11px/10px and tiny radius in many places. Relax to 12px for labels and slightly larger radius so we "look more shadcn."
- **Compact via data-density** — Support compact density via `data-density="compact"` for power users; default appearance aligns with shadcn for elegance.

## 6. Professional and elegant

- **Consistent spacing** — Use tokens only (`--panel-padding`, `--control-gap`, etc.); no ad-hoc `px-*`/`py-*` in editor chrome.
- **Consistent icon set** — Lucide React throughout; standard size **12px** (`size-3` or `var(--icon-size)`) and outline style. Menu items and toolbar actions must include an icon where the action benefits from visual recognition (e.g. Fit view, Open workbench, Save, editor creation buttons).
- **Semantic tokens only** — No hardcoded colors; use `--background`, `--foreground`, `--border`, `--context-accent`, `--glow-*`, etc.

## Relation to other design docs

- **Density and tokens** — Still defined in [01 - Styling and theming](01-styling-and-theming.mdx). This doc replaces "Sharpness over softness" as the primary visual direction while keeping density tokens.
- **Components** — [02 - Components](02-components.mdx) lists atoms and molecules; they should adhere to this language (subtle focus/selection, radius, type scale).
