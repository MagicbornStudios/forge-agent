# Styling and theming

## Visual direction

- **Spotify/Photoshop-inspired**: clean, dense, high-contrast hierarchy with muted borders and purposeful accents.
- **Declarative shadcn**: use shadcn UI primitives (DropdownMenu, Select, Sheet, Card, Button, etc.) instead of hand-rolled UI.
- **Mode theming**: app theme is the base (driven by `ui.theme` via `AppThemeProvider`), modes may override via `EditorShell theme`.
- **Atomic design**: atoms live in `packages/ui/src/components/ui/*` (shadcn). Build molecules and organisms from those primitives.

## UI rules

- Prefer semantic tokens (`--background`, `--foreground`, `--border`) from `packages/shared/src/shared/styles/themes.css`.
- Avoid single-purpose UI components per workspace; extend shared components and document the slot.
- Standard toolbar layout: File menu + Project select + Settings (plus domain actions).

## Accessibility

- Preserve focus rings and keyboard navigation (shadcn defaults).
- Use `aria-label` for icon-only controls.
