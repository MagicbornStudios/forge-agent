# Studio vs Platform

## Overview [#overview]

| App | Role | Port | Purpose |
|-----|------|------|---------|
| **Studio** | Creator / authoring | 3000 | Edit graphs, characters, dialogue. AI assistant. Payload backend. |
| **Platform** | Customer / marketplace | 3001 | Docs, marketing, content. Connects to Studio for Open Studio links. |

Both are Next.js apps in the monorepo. Shared packages (`@forge/ui`, `@forge/shared`) are used by both.

---

## Studio [#studio]

**`apps/studio`** — The creator-facing application.

- **Editors:** Dialogue (Forge graph), Character (relationship graph), Video (Twick)
- **Data:** Payload CMS (projects, forge-graphs, characters, users, settings)
- **AI:** Assistant UI, domain tools, model routing (OpenRouter)
- **Env:** `apps/studio/.env.local` — Payload, OpenRouter, Stripe, etc.

**Run:** `pnpm dev` from root (Studio is the default). Or `pnpm --filter @forge/studio dev` for Studio only.

**Entry:** `http://localhost:3000`

---

## Platform [#platform]

**`apps/platform`** — The customer-facing application.

- **Content:** Docs (Fumadocs), marketing pages, product content
- **Auth:** Platform users; connects to Studio for credentialed API calls when needed
- **Env:** `apps/platform/.env.local` — `NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_APP_URL` (Studio API URL), analytics

**Run:** `pnpm --filter @forge/platform dev` — starts on port 3001.

**Entry:** `http://localhost:3001`

---

## How they work together [#together]

- **Env boundary:** Platform's `NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_APP_URL` points to Studio (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`). Platform uses this for "Open Studio" links and any credentialed requests to Studio APIs.
- **Shared packages:** Both use `@forge/ui`, `@forge/shared`, domain packages. UI and editor primitives are shared.
- **Data:** Studio owns Payload and all creator data. Platform may fetch public content or proxy to Studio for auth-gated data.

**CORS:** Studio can allow Platform origins via `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `PLATFORM_APP_URL` (see [Environment variables](../reference/environment-variables.mdx)).

## When to work in each [#when]

| Task | App |
|------|-----|
| Editor chrome, AI assistant, graph logic | Studio |
| New editor type (e.g. Strategy) | Studio |
| Payload collections, API routes | Studio |
| Docs content, marketing pages | Platform |
| Product landing, pricing UI | Platform |
| Shared components (atoms, molecules) | `packages/ui`, `packages/shared` |

**Single dev flow:** Most day-to-day work is in Studio. Platform is for docs and customer-facing content. When adding a feature that spans both (e.g. "Open Studio" from Platform), implement Studio APIs first, then Platform calls them.
