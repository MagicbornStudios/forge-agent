# Environment portal

Env GUI flow is now RepoStudio-first, backed by `@forge/forge-env`.

## Default launcher behavior

- `pnpm env:portal` and `forge-env portal` try to launch RepoStudio Env workspace first.
- If RepoStudio is unavailable, fallback is the legacy inline portal UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3847`.
- `forge-env portal --bootstrap` always uses bootstrap behavior that blocks until required keys are satisfied.

## Force legacy portal

```bash
forge-env portal --legacy-portal
```

## Typical flow

1. Run doctor: `forge-env doctor --mode headless --strict`.
2. Open GUI: `forge-repo-studio open --view env --mode headless`.
3. Reconcile/write: `forge-env reconcile --write --sync-examples`.
4. Re-run doctor.

## Notes

- In `forge-agent` profile, env targets include `apps/studio` and `apps/platform`.
- Discovery now scans workspace targets from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- Reconcile is non-destructive by default (union + preserve, backups on write).
