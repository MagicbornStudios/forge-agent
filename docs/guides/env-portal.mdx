# Environment portal

The env portal is a localhost-only web UI for editing `.env.local` for Studio and Platform. It reads from `scripts/env/manifest.mjs` and writes to `apps/studio/.env.local` and `apps/platform/.env.local`.

## When it opens

- **Bootstrap:** Running `pnpm dev` runs `pnpm env:bootstrap` first. If required keys are missing for the current app, the portal opens in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:3847`.
- **Manual:** Run `pnpm env:portal` anytime to open the portal for ad-hoc edits.

To skip bootstrap (e.g. CI): set `FORGE_SKIP_ENV_BOOTSTRAP=1` or `CI=1`.

## What you see

The portal shows two app sections: **@forge/studio** and **@forge/platform**. Each section lists variables grouped by manifest section:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| Core runtime | PAYLOAD_SECRET, DATABASE_URI, NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL |
| Local developer bootstrap | Auto-admin, seed overrides |
| AI and model routing | OpenRouter keys, LangGraph flags |
| Stripe and billing | Stripe keys, price ids |
| Media upload and voice | S3, ElevenLabs |
| Analytics and logging | PostHog, LOG_LEVEL |
| etc. | |

Required fields for local mode are highlighted. Secret fields use password inputs.

## Flow

1. **Fill** — Enter values for required keys (e.g. `PAYLOAD_SECRET`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).
2. **Save** — Click Save. The portal writes to `.env.local`.
3. **Rerun** — If you opened via bootstrap, the server exits after save. Rerun `pnpm dev` to start the app.

## Vercel sync

The portal includes an optional **Vercel** section for syncing env vars to Vercel projects. Configure in `.env.vercel.local`:

- `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` — For API access
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_STUDIO` — Studio project id/name
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_PLATFORM` — Platform project id/name

Then use **Sync to Vercel** in the portal, or run `pnpm env:sync:vercel` from the CLI.

See [28 — Vercel and Supabase launch](how-to/28-vercel-supabase-launch.mdx) for the full deploy flow.
