# Coding agent strategy

How to use agent artifacts. Entry: root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), README, [index](index) § I'm a coding agent.

## Loop

1. **Before:** Read [STATUS](agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md) and relevant AGENTS.md; check [errors-and-attempts](agent-artifacts/core/errors-and-attempts.md). For long artifacts, see [tool-usage § Reading long artifacts](agent-artifacts/core/tool-usage.md).
2. **Pick:** STATUS § Next or [task-registry](agent-artifacts/core/task-registry.md).
3. **Implement:** One slice; scope to apps, packages, docs.
4. **After:** Update STATUS (Ralph Wiggum Done), scan docs for drift per loop.

**Forge-loop lifecycle:** AI runtimes and Database workspace work are tracked under **Phase 13** (`.planning/ROADMAP.md`). For similar multi-slice or corrective work, use the forge-loop lifecycle: discuss-phase → plan-phase → execute-phase → verify-work → sync-legacy.

## Doc improvements

When fleshing out docs, follow [docs-building](agent-artifacts/core/docs-building.md): page length, QuickNav, ShowcaseLink, catalog as single source. Add improvement ideas to [enhanced-features-backlog](agent-artifacts/core/enhanced-features-backlog.md) with "docs" tag; do not implement proposed items until a human sets status to accepted.

## Key artifacts

- **STATUS** — Current state, Done list
- **docs-building** — Doc structure, showcase, env, settings; when to update. [docs-building](agent-artifacts/core/docs-building.md)
- **decisions** — ADRs
- **errors-and-attempts** — Do not repeat; user correction overrides
- **tool-usage** — rg, list_dir, Read; AGENT_SECTION
- **task-registry** — Granular tasks

## User correction

When the user explicitly rejects a hypothesis or forbids a fix: **stop**. Document in errors-and-attempts. Do not re-implement.

## Scope

Do not modify `.tmp/` or agent-download directories. Scope edits to apps, packages, docs.

## UI/styling

After implementing: update design docs and STATUS. Do **not** run browser screenshot automation. See [styling-and-ui-consistency](agent-artifacts/core/styling-and-ui-consistency.md) and [how-to 26](how-to/26-styling-debugging-with-cursor).
