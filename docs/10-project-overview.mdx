# Forge Agent - Project overview

## Product vision

Forge Agent is an **AI-first interactive narrative storytelling engine**. It
combines visual graph editing, AI-assisted authoring, and multi-modal content
creation into a unified editor platform inspired by Unreal Engine's editor UI.

### MVP and first revenue

We focus on **funding quickly** while delivering clear value. **MVP** = one end-to-end clone/download; **success** = first paid clone end-to-end; first paid = **cloneable project/template**; **creators list from day one**; **paid + free tier**; **catalog** (users + orgs); **revenue share** (platform + creator). **Yarn export in MVP.** **MVP editors** = Dialogue, Character, Writer, GamePlayer; Video and Strategy editor **not in MVP**. **MVP infra** = Vercel + Payload. **Platform** = marketing site (landing + platform). Two hero moments: (1) **Author a small game fully with AI** using Studio, or (2) **Layer Studio on existing projects** — create content and **download** our **Codebase Agent Strategy** core (docs + AGENTS.md). See [MVP and first revenue](product/mvp-and-revenue.mdx) for audience, positioning, clone semantics, and evolution.

### Positioning and audience

- **Positioning:** Game/narrative **content authoring engine**, AI- and chat-first. We are a **thin** game engine — the content + agent layer, not a full engine.
- **Audience:** Writers; game content/narrative teams; indie game devs; AAA teams (prototype or enhance coding agents and analytics for more ambitious games).

### Core identity

- **Interactive narrative storytelling** - build branching dialogue, character
  relationships, and cinematic sequences with AI assistance.
- **Yarn Spinner compatible** - first-class support for the Yarn Spinner
  dialogue scripting language used across Unity, Unreal, and Godot.
- **Editors as MCP Apps** - each editor can be exposed as an MCP App for
  embedding in external hosts (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code).

### Editors

| Editor | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Dialogue** | Yarn Spinner dialogue graph editing (narratives + storylets) | Primary (MVP) |
| **Character** | Character relationship graph editing | In progress (MVP) |
| **Writer** | Lexical-based, branching narrative, interactive narrative + Yarn; thin engine produces Yarn Games | Planned (MVP) |
| **GamePlayer** | Playable runtime for Yarn Games (thin engine) | MVP (to be built) |
| **Video** | Twick timeline video editing | Not in MVP (locked until after MVP) |
| **Strategy** | AI agent strategy chat (assistant-ui + tool-ui); Strategy = core docs + AGENTS.md | Not in MVP (downloadable core in scope) |

### Key capabilities

- Editor shell with resizable, dockable, lockable panels (DockLayout).
- CopilotKit for in-app AI context, actions, and suggestions.
- assistant-ui + tool-ui for conversational AI interfaces.
- Payload CMS (SQLite) for local-first persistence.
- Payload-generated types used across systems (domain packages) for consistent schemas.
- **Plan tiers** (free vs paid); **cloud subscription** for standard users (no API keys).
- **OpenRouter** first-class for multi-model AI; **ElevenLabs** and **Sora** (OpenAPI) for advanced media.
- **Strategy** = core docs + AGENTS.md; downloadable core. Clone semantics: pay once → access indefinitely, clone as many times as desired; version snapshot at clone.

## Architecture (high level)

- **App Shell** (`apps/studio/components/AppShell.tsx`, `apps/studio/lib/app-shell/store.ts`): owns editor tabs and the active editor. Only the active editor is rendered.
- **Editors**: Dialogue is primary. Character and Video are editors; Strategy is the assistant-ui strategy editor.
- **Shared**: `packages/shared/src/shared` contains the editor UI kit, headless contracts, assistant-ui/tool-ui components, and styling tokens.
- **Agent engine**: `packages/agent-engine` provides the workflow runtime (steps + events + SSE helpers).
- **Dev kit**: `packages/dev-kit` re-exports `@forge/shared` and `@forge/agent-engine` for consumers (UI atoms are in `@forge/ui`).
- **Systems (domain packages)**: Dialogue system logic lives in `packages/domain-forge` and consumes types from `packages/types`.
- **Types**: Payload generates types into `packages/types/src/payload-types.ts`. Domain aliases live in `packages/types/src/payload.ts` and `packages/types/src/graph.ts`.
- **Persistence**: Payload runs inside the Studio app. Collections live under `apps/studio/payload/collections`.
- **Settings**: Config-based defaults in `apps/studio/lib/settings/config.ts`. Overrides are loaded from Payload (`settings-overrides`) on app init via `GET /api/settings` and `hydrateFromOverrides`; saved explicitly via the settings sheet Save button and `POST /api/settings`.

Note: API routes exist inside the Studio app for CopilotKit, assistant-chat, and Payload operations, but they are internal to the app and not treated as separate services.

## Codebase layout (what each folder does)

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **apps/studio/app/** | Next.js App Router: layout, page, globals.css, internal API routes. |
| **apps/studio/components/** | Studio UI (AppShell, editors, settings, providers, shadcn UI). |
| **apps/studio/payload/** | Payload config and collections for Studio. |
| **apps/studio/lib/** | App logic (stores, model router, settings, graph operations, utils). |
| **packages/shared/** | Shared editor UI kit and headless contracts. |
| **packages/agent-engine/** | Workflow runtime (steps + events + SSE). |
| **packages/dev-kit/** | Meta-package that re-exports forge shared + agent-engine for consumers (UI atoms in `@forge/ui`). |
| **packages/domain-forge/** | Dialogue system (domain package) logic (types, store, operations, copilot wiring). |
| **packages/ui/** | Shared shadcn UI atoms (Radix-based primitives). |
| **packages/types/** | Payload-generated types + domain aliases (source of truth). |
| **docs/** | Documentation (STATUS, architecture, design, guides). How-to guides live in `docs/how-to/` (numbered 00-09, 21-22) and are also served in-app at `/docs`. |
| **__tests__/** | Jest tests. |
| **__mocks__/** | Jest mocks (server-only, etc.). |

| **apps/studio/next.config.ts** | Next config + transpile workspace packages. |
| **apps/studio/payload.config.ts** | Payload config; generates types into `packages/types`. |
| **packages/types/src/payload-types.ts** | Generated Payload types (do not edit). |
| **packages/types/src/payload.ts** | Domain aliases for payload-generated types. |

## Entry and data flow

- **Entry**: `apps/studio/app/layout.tsx` -> `apps/studio/app/page.tsx`.
- **AppShell**: Reads app-shell store and renders the active editor. Editor tabs use shared components from `@forge/shared`.
- **Dialogue editor**: Composes `EditorShell` and `DockLayout` from `@forge/shared` with the GraphEditor as the main surface.
- **CopilotKit**: The active editor registers context + actions from system wiring; the chat uses those to propose edits.
- **Payload**: Collections define persisted shapes; generated types are used by system logic for type safety.

---

## How-to guides

Numbered guides in `docs/how-to/` build an editor from the ground up. They are served in the Studio app at **/docs** (sidebar + article). Order: 01 Foundation -> 02 Editor shell and slots -> 03 Styling -> 04 Data and state -> 05 Building an editor -> 06 Dialogue Editor walkthrough -> 07 Copilot and AI integration -> 08 Adding AI to editors -> 09 Video Editor walkthrough -> 21 Workspace -> Editor migration -> 22 AI generation components. Each guide includes "What the AI can do at this stage" and points to real code.
