# Forge Agent - Project overview

## Project summary

Forge Agent is an AI-first studio for editing dialogue graphs. It focuses on:

- Unified workspace shell with multiple sub-workspaces (Forge is primary; Video is a UI showcase).
- CopilotKit for in-app AI context, actions, and suggestions.
- Payload CMS (SQLite) for local-first persistence.
- Payload-generated types used across domains for consistent schemas.

## Tech stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router, Turbopack)
- React 19
- TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS 4
- shadcn/ui (Radix UI)
- Zustand
- CopilotKit
- OpenRouter (AI SDK + OpenAI provider)
- React Flow
- Payload CMS (SQLite)

---

## Architecture (high level)

- **App Shell** (`apps/studio/components/AppShell.tsx`, `apps/studio/lib/app-shell/store.ts`): owns workspace tabs and active workspace. Only the active workspace is rendered.
- **Workspaces**: Forge is primary. Video exists as a UI showcase only.
- **Shared**: `packages/shared/src/shared` contains the workspace UI kit, headless contracts, and styling tokens.
- **Agent engine**: `packages/agent-engine` provides the workflow runtime (steps + events + SSE helpers).
- **Dev kit**: `packages/dev-kit` re-exports `@forge/ui`, `@forge/shared`, and `@forge/agent-engine` for consumers.
- **Domains**: Forge logic lives in `packages/domain-forge` and consumes types from `packages/types`.
- **Types**: Payload generates types into `packages/types/src/payload-types.ts`. Domain aliases live in `packages/types/src/payload.ts` and `packages/types/src/graph.ts`.
- **Persistence**: Payload runs inside the Studio app. Collections live under `apps/studio/payload/collections`.
- **Settings**: Config-based defaults in `apps/studio/lib/settings/config.ts`. Overrides are loaded from Payload (`settings-overrides`) on app init via `GET /api/settings` and `hydrateFromOverrides`; saved explicitly via the settings sheet Save button and `POST /api/settings`.

Note: API routes exist inside the Studio app for CopilotKit and Payload operations, but they are internal to the app and not treated as separate services.

## Codebase layout (what each folder does)

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **apps/studio/app/** | Next.js App Router: layout, page, globals.css, internal API routes. |
| **apps/studio/components/** | Studio UI (AppShell, workspaces, settings, providers, shadcn UI). |
| **apps/studio/payload/** | Payload config and collections for Studio. |
| **apps/studio/lib/** | App logic (stores, model router, settings, graph operations, utils). |
| **packages/shared/** | Shared workspace UI kit and headless contracts. |
| **packages/agent-engine/** | Workflow runtime (steps + events + SSE). |
| **packages/dev-kit/** | Meta-package that re-exports forge foundation packages for consumers. |
| **packages/domain-forge/** | Forge domain logic (types, store, operations, copilot wiring). |
| **packages/ui/** | Shared shadcn UI atoms (Radix-based primitives). |
| **packages/types/** | Payload-generated types + domain aliases (source of truth). |
| **docs/** | Documentation (STATUS, architecture, design, guides). How-to guides live in `docs/how-to/` (numbered 00-09) and are also served in-app at `/docs`. |
| **__tests__/** | Jest tests. |
| **__mocks__/** | Jest mocks (server-only, etc.). |

## Key configuration files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **package.json** | Workspace root scripts (pnpm filters for Studio). |
| **apps/studio/package.json** | Studio app deps and scripts. |
| **apps/studio/tsconfig.json** | Studio TS config and path aliases. |
| **apps/studio/next.config.ts** | Next config + transpile workspace packages. |
| **apps/studio/tailwind.config.ts** | Tailwind v4 content includes Studio and packages. |
| **apps/studio/payload.config.ts** | Payload config; generates types into `packages/types`. |
| **packages/types/src/payload-types.ts** | Generated Payload types (do not edit). |
| **packages/types/src/payload.ts** | Domain aliases for payload-generated types. |
| **apps/studio/components.json** | shadcn/ui config. |
| **jest.config.js** | Jest config with moduleNameMapper for workspace aliases. |

## Entry and data flow

- **Entry**: `apps/studio/app/layout.tsx` -> `apps/studio/app/page.tsx`.
- **AppShell**: Reads app-shell store and renders the active workspace. Workspace tabs use shared components from `@forge/shared`.
- **Forge workspace**: Composes `WorkspaceShell` and `WorkspaceLayoutGrid` from `@forge/shared` with the GraphEditor as the main surface.
- **CopilotKit**: Workspace registers context + actions from Forge domain wiring; the chat uses those to propose edits.
- **Payload**: Collections define persisted shapes; generated types are used by domain logic for type safety.

---

## How-to guides

Numbered guides in `docs/how-to/` build a workspace from the ground up. They are served in the Studio app at **/docs** (sidebar + article). Order: 01 Foundation -> 02 Workspace shell and slots -> 03 Styling -> 04 Data and state -> 05 Building a workspace -> 06 ForgeWorkspace walkthrough -> 07 Copilot and AI integration -> 08 Adding AI to workspaces -> 09 Twick video workspace. Each guide includes "What the AI can do at this stage" and points to real code.
