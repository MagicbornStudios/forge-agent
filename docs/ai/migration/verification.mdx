# Verification checklist

After implementation, confirm each capability:

---

## Basic chat

Open Dialogue editor, chat with Assistant, see streaming responses.

---

## Tool execution

"Create a character node" → node appears in graph, highlighted.

---

## Plan workflow

"Add 3 connected dialogue nodes" → plan appears in chat → click Apply → nodes created.

---

## Cross-editor

"Create a character named Alice" from app-level chat → character created → visible in Character tab.

---

## MCP

External MCP client can list tools and execute `forge_createNode`.

---

## Coexistence

Toggle `USE_ASSISTANT_UI` flag → both systems work independently during migration.
