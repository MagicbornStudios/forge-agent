# AI architecture diagrams

Mermaid diagrams used in the AI docs. Diagrams are embedded inline in the architecture docs; this folder can hold reusable snippets if needed.

## Embedding

Use a mermaid fenced code block in MDX: open with ` ```mermaid `, write the diagram, close with ` ``` `. See [00-index.mdx](../00-index.mdx) and [01-architecture-overview.mdx](../01-architecture-overview.mdx) for examples.
