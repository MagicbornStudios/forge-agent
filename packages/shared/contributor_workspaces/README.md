# Contributor editors

Community editors live here. We expect every new contributor to build their own editor and add it here via a PR.

## How to contribute an editor

1. **Build an editor** using the repo how-tos: start with [05 - Building an editor](../../../docs/how-to/05-building-a-workspace.mdx) (and optionally [06 - Dialogue Editor walkthrough](../../../docs/how-to/06-forge-workspace-walkthrough.mdx) or [09 - Video Editor walkthrough](../../../docs/how-to/09-twick-workspace.mdx)).
2. **Implement your editor** (shell, slots, domain contract, optional AI actions).
3. **Open a PR** that adds a subfolder under this directory, e.g. `contributor_workspaces/my-awesome-editor/`, with your editor code and a **README** that describes what it does and how to run it.

We'll review and merge; once wired into the app shell (in a follow-up), your editor will be part of the showcase.
