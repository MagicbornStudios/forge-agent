# Product roadmap

AI-first interactive narrative engine. Ralph Wiggum loop: read STATUS → implement slice → update STATUS.

**MVP:** Dialogue, Character, Writer, GamePlayer. Video and Strategy editor not in MVP. Success = first paid clone E2E. See [MVP](../product/mvp-and-revenue).

**Next:** [STATUS § Next](../agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md). Granular tasks: [task-registry](../agent-artifacts/core/task-registry.md).

## Active editors

| Editor | Status | Focus |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Dialogue | In progress | Yarn Spinner, plan→patch→review, dual graph panels |
| Character | In progress | Relationship graph, ElevenLabs voice |
| GamePlayer | MVP (to build) | Playable Yarn Games runtime |
| Video | Locked | Twick timeline; capability-gated |
| Strategy | After MVP | Assistant UI chat, downloadable core in scope |

## Platform initiatives

- **MCP** — Studio + editors as MCP apps; app tools, editor registration
- **Yarn Spinner** — Export/import `.yarn`; full implementation planned
- **Dev-kit single entrypoint** — One package, one CSS, create-forge-app

**Next:** [Potential ideas](potential-ideas)
