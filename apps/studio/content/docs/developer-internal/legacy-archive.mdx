title: Legacy archive
description: Archived pointer for the pre-baseline Studio docs source.
---

Studio docs previously sourced content from the repository-level `docs/` tree via `apps/studio/source.config.ts`.

That legacy source is now archived as a reference pointer at:

- `apps/studio/content/docs-archive/README.md`
- `docs/` (original source retained in-place)
