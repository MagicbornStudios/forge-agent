# Why Use Forge?

**Build narrative-driven projects in days, not months**

Forge is to dialogue and narrative what the Unity Asset Store is to game development. We provide the meta-content layer that sits above your game engine, handling story structure, character relationships, dialogue systems, and narrative context so you can focus on your unique creative vision.

## The Problem: Creative Teams Move Too Slowly

Building custom narrative tools is a massive time sink that pulls developers away from their actual game or interactive experience:

- **6+ months** to build a custom dialogue editor from scratch
- **No AI integration** - you build everything yourself
- **Context continuity nightmares** - tracking story state across branches is manual
- **No progress visibility** - teams struggle to answer "how far along are we?"
- **Maintenance burden** - every custom tool needs ongoing support

### What Teams Struggle With

Creative projects lack the natural structure that software projects have. In code, you have files, functions, and tests. In narrative work, you have:

- **Direction without structure** - "Act 2" means different things to different people
- **Progress tracking** - How do you measure story completion?
- **Context continuity** - Did the player already meet this character? In what context?
- **Team coordination** - Writers, designers, and developers need shared language
- **Branching complexity** - Storylets and choice trees grow exponentially

---

## The Solution: Narrative-First Infrastructure

Forge provides the complete infrastructure layer for narrative development, just like Unity provides physics and rendering for games.

### The Unity Asset Store Model for Narrative

**Unity/Unreal handle:**
- Physics simulation
- Graphics rendering
- Audio systems
- Input management

**Forge handles:**
- Narrative structure (Acts → Chapters → Pages)
- Character relationships and context
- Dialogue systems (linear + branching storylets)
- Story state and continuity tracking
- AI-powered content generation

You wouldn't build your own physics engine. Why build your own dialogue system?

### Linear Narrative = Built-In Progress Tracker

The key insight: **linear narrative structure provides natural project tracking**.

When you organize your story as:
```
Act 1: Setup
  → Chapter 1: Introduction
    → Page 1: Opening scene
    → Page 2: Meet the mentor
  → Chapter 2: Call to adventure
    → Page 3: The inciting incident
```

You immediately know:
- **Where you are** - Chapter 2, Page 3
- **What's left** - Chapters 3-5 not started
- **Team status** - Writer finished Act 1, designer on Act 2
- **Completion** - 2 of 5 acts complete = 40%

This applies to games, interactive fiction, educational content, and any narrative-driven experience.

### Context Continuity Tracking

Forge automatically maintains narrative context across your entire project:

- **Character state** - Has the player met this character? What's their relationship?
- **Story flags** - Which quests completed? Which choices made?
- **Dialogue history** - What conversations already happened?
- **Branching paths** - Track multiple storylines and their confluence points
- **AI awareness** - AI assistants understand your full narrative context

No more manual spreadsheets. No more forgotten story flags. No more continuity errors.

## Speed Comparison: 6 Months vs 1 Week

### Building Custom (Traditional Approach)

**Timeline: 6+ months**

1. **Month 1-2:** Requirements and design
   - Research dialogue systems
   - Design custom data models
   - Create wireframes and mockups

2. **Month 3-4:** Core development
   - Build editor UI from scratch
   - Implement save/load system
   - Create graph visualization
   - Version control integration

3. **Month 5:** Polish and testing
   - Bug fixes
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation

4. **Month 6+:** Ongoing maintenance
   - Fix issues as they arise
   - Add requested features
   - Update dependencies

**Result:** A custom tool that does exactly what you need, but consumed half a year of development time and requires ongoing maintenance.

### Building with Forge

**Timeline: 1 week**

1. **Day 1:** Setup and familiarization
   ```bash
   npm install @forge/dev-kit
   ```
   - Explore component library
   - Review example editors

2. **Day 2-3:** Build your editor
   ```typescript
   import { EditorShell, EditorDockLayout } from '@forge/dev-kit';

   export function QuestEditor() {
     return (
       <EditorShell editorId="quests" title="Quest Editor">
         <EditorDockLayout layoutId="quests-layout">
           {/* Your custom quest UI */}
         </EditorDockLayout>
       </EditorShell>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Customize for your domain
   - Add AI integration

3. **Day 4-5:** Polish and deploy
   - Test with your content
   - Deploy to Forge Platform
   - Optional: Submit to Developer Program

**Result:** Production-ready editor with AI integration, cloud storage, and professional UI in one week.

## Why Now?

The convergence of three trends makes this the perfect time for Forge:

### 1. AI-Powered Content Creation
AI can now generate coherent narrative content, but needs structure and context to be useful. Forge provides both.

### 2. Remote Team Collaboration
Distributed teams need shared tools and clear progress metrics. Narrative structure provides both naturally.

### 3. Rising Production Costs
Custom tool development is expensive. Reusable infrastructure saves months of development time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Forge a game engine?

No. Forge handles the narrative/dialogue/character layer. You still use Unity, Unreal, Godot, or custom engines for gameplay, rendering, and physics. Think of Forge as complementary to game engines.

### Can I use my own AI models?

Yes. Forge integrates with OpenRouter for multi-model routing, but you can bring your own API keys or use local models.

### What if I need to migrate away?

Export your data anytime in JSON or Yarn Spinner format. No lock-in. Your content is yours.

### How does the Developer Program work?

Build custom editors with our dev-kit, submit for review, earn 70% of sales when other teams buy your editor. Like the Unity Asset Store for narrative tools.

### Do you support languages other than English?

Yes. Forge is internationalization-ready. Your content can be in any language, and AI assistants support 50+ languages.
