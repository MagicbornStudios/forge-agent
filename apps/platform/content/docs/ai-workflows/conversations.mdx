# Conversation Workflows

Use conversation workflows when requirements evolve during implementation.

## Recommended loop

1. Describe one vertical slice.
2. Ask for concrete implementation output.
3. Review and request exact edits.
4. Validate with build/test.
5. Repeat with the next slice.

## Prompting pattern

- State goal and scope.
- Provide constraints and non-goals.
- Request file-level outputs.
- Ask for verification commands.

## Success criteria

- Every iteration lands in runnable state.
- Changes remain scoped and reversible.
- Docs and examples stay in sync with code.
