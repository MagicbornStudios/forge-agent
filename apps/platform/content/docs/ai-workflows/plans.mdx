# Plan Workflows

Use planning workflows for larger refactors and cross-cutting changes.

## Plan-first checklist

1. Define target UX and API outcomes.
2. List exact files and interfaces to change.
3. Capture edge cases and rollback paths.
4. Define validation gates before implementation.
5. Implement in deterministic slices.

## Review checkpoints

- Schema and routing compatibility
- Link and navigation integrity
- Component coverage completeness
- Build and doctor script pass status

## Default execution model

- Platform-safe first
- Developer-depth second
- Guardrails last, then final pass
