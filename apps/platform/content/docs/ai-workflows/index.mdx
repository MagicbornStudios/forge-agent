Forge Platform integrates AI throughout the development workflow - from planning to implementation to content generation.

---

## What are AI Workflows?

AI Workflows are structured patterns for using AI to accelerate development and content creation on Forge Platform.

### Three Core Workflows

1. **[Cloning](/docs/ai-workflows/cloning)** - Clone and customize existing editors
2. **[Conversations](/docs/ai-workflows/conversations)** - Build through natural language dialogue
3. **[Plans](/docs/ai-workflows/plans)** - AI generates implementation plans you approve

---

## When to Use Each Workflow

### Use Cloning When...

- ✅ Similar editor exists (Character, Dialogue, Task)
- ✅ You want to customize for your domain
- ✅ Fastest path to working prototype
- ⏱️ **Time: 5-30 minutes**

**Example**: Clone Character Editor → Customize for employee database

---

### Use Conversations When...

- ✅ Building from components
- ✅ Iterative development style
- ✅ Learning as you build
- ⏱️ **Time: 1-3 hours**

**Example**: "Build a recipe editor with ingredient tracking and meal planning"

---

### Use Plans When...

- ✅ Complex custom requirements
- ✅ Want to review before building
- ✅ Team needs approval process
- ⏱️ **Time: 2-8 hours**

**Example**: Multi-editor platform with custom domain logic

## AI Capabilities

### What AI Can Do

**Generate Code**:
- Component compositions
- Data models and types
- Event handlers
- Form validations
- API integrations

**Generate Content**:
- Dialogue and narratives
- Character descriptions
- Documentation
- Test data
- UI copy

**Provide Guidance**:
- Architecture decisions
- Component selection
- Best practices
- Debugging help
- Performance optimization

---

### What AI Cannot Do

**Decision Making**:
- ❌ Business logic decisions
- ❌ UX design choices
- ❌ Data model design
- ❌ Security policies

**Domain Expertise**:
- ❌ Game design decisions
- ❌ Brand voice and tone
- ❌ Legal compliance
- ❌ Domain-specific rules

**Complex Reasoning**:
- ❌ Multi-system architecture
- ❌ Complex state management
- ❌ Performance optimization
- ❌ Security auditing

## AI Best Practices

### Give Good Context

**Bad prompt**:
```
"Build an editor"
```

**Good prompt**:
```
"Build a recipe editor with:
- Left panel: category tree (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- Center: recipe cards with images
- Right: ingredient list and instructions
- AI feature: generate variations (vegan, gluten-free)
Use @forge/dev-kit components"
```

### Be Specific About Requirements

**Bad**:
```
"Add a form"
```

**Good**:
```
"Add a form with:
- Name (required, max 50 chars)
- Email (validated email format)
- Role (dropdown: viewer, editor, admin)
- Submit button that calls /api/users"
```

### Iterate in Small Steps

**Bad approach**:
```
"Build entire application with all features"
```

**Good approach**:
```
1. "Set up EditorShell with basic layout"
2. "Add left sidebar with category tree"
3. "Add main panel with item cards"
4. "Add inspector panel for details"
5. "Connect to API and add CRUD operations"
```

### Review and Refine

**Workflow**:
1. AI generates code
2. You review for correctness
3. Test functionality
4. Request refinements
5. Iterate until satisfied

## AI Integration Points

### During Development

**Component Selection**:
```
You: "I need a modal dialog"
AI: "Use <Dialog> from @forge/ui with DialogContent and DialogTitle"
```

**Code Generation**:
```tsx
You: "Generate a user profile form"
AI: <generates>
<Form>
  <Input name="name" label="Full Name" required />
  <Input name="email" type="email" label="Email" required />
  <Textarea name="bio" label="Bio" rows={4} />
  <Button type="submit">Save Profile</Button>
</Form>
```

**Debugging**:
```
You: "This component isn't updating"
AI: "Check if you're using useState for the value.
     Also make sure onChange is calling the setter."
```

### During Content Creation

**Dialogue Generation**:
```
You: "Generate merchant dialogue, friendly but greedy"
AI: <generates Yarn Spinner dialogue with personality>
```

**Character Creation**:
```
You: "Create a rival character for my protagonist"
AI: <generates character profile with conflicts and motivations>
```

**Documentation**:
```
You: "Document this component's props"
AI: <generates JSDoc comments with examples>
```

## Security and Privacy

### What AI Can Access

**✅ Allowed**:
- Your current project structure
- Component library documentation
- Your explicitly provided context
- Public Forge documentation

**❌ Not Allowed**:
- Other users' projects
- Private API keys
- Sensitive user data
- Production databases

### Data Handling

**During generation**:
- AI processes your prompts and context
- Generated code is yours to keep
- No training on your private data

**Privacy controls**:
- Opt out of AI features anytime
- Delete conversation history
- Control what context AI can access

---

## Pricing and Limits

### AI Usage Limits

- Basic content generation
- Code completion

**Pro Tier** ($29/month):
- 1,000 AI requests per month
- Advanced generation
- Priority processing

**Team Tier** ($99/month):
- 10,000 AI requests per month

### What Counts as a Request

**Single request**:
- One message to AI
- One code generation
- One content generation

**Does not count**:
- Documentation lookup
- Type hints
- Error messages
