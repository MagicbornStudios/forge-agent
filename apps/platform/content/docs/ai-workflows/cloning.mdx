# Cloning Workflows

Use cloning when you want the fastest path from idea to working editor.

## Recommended flow

1. Pick the closest baseline editor.
2. Clone layout and panel structure first.
3. Rename domain types and labels.
4. Replace domain data hooks and actions.
5. Add audience-specific settings and AI tools.

## Good candidates

- Character data tools
- Task and planning editors
- Content review and approval surfaces

## What to avoid

- Cloning without replacing domain contracts
- Reusing old settings keys across unrelated domains
- Skipping integration tests after structural changes
