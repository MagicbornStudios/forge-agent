  EditorShell,
  EditorDockLayout,
  EditorDockPanel,

export function MyCustomEditor() {
  return (
    <EditorShell
      editorId="my-custom-editor"
      title="My Custom Editor"
    >
      <EditorToolbar>
        {/* Your custom toolbar */}
      </EditorToolbar>

      <EditorDockLayout layoutId="custom-layout">
        <EditorDockLayout.Main>
          <EditorDockPanel id="main" title="Main View">
            {/* Your editor UI */}

## Requirements & Guidelines

### Technical Requirements

**Must use `@forge/dev-kit`**

All editors must be built on our component library:

```typescript
// ✅ Good - uses Forge components
import { EditorShell, DockLayout } from '@forge/dev-kit';

// ❌ Bad - completely custom implementation
import { CustomShell } from './my-custom-lib';
```

**TypeScript strongly recommended**

Type-safe editors are easier to maintain:

```typescript
import type { EditorConfig, PanelConfig } from '@forge/dev-kit/types';

interface QuestEditorState {
  quests: Quest[];
  selectedQuest: string | null;
}
```

**Performance benchmarks**

- Initial load: < 2 seconds
- Panel rendering: < 100ms
- Data save: < 500ms

Support latest versions of:
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium)

- Theme variables for colors
- Standard spacing and typography
- Consistent iconography

**Responsive layouts**

- Support window resizing
- Panels collapse gracefully
- Mobile-friendly (if applicable)

**Dark/light theme support**

Inherit from EditorShell:
- No hardcoded colors

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to be a company to join?

No. Individual developers, freelancers, and companies can all join. You'll need to provide tax information for revenue payouts.

### Can I sell my editor elsewhere?

Yes, but it must use `@forge/dev-kit` which requires Forge Platform. You can't strip out Forge dependencies and sell standalone.

### What if my editor stops working due to platform updates?

We provide advance notice (minimum 90 days) for breaking changes and detailed migration guides. We work with developers to ensure smooth transitions.

### Can I offer free trials?

Yes. You control pricing, including free tiers, trial periods, and freemium models.

### How do refunds work?

Customers can request refunds within 14 days. We handle refund requests and absorb the cost. You keep your 70% of non-refunded sales.

### Can I update my editor after publication?

Yes. Push updates anytime through the Developer Portal. Users get automatic updates. We recommend a changelog and version numbering.

### What happens if I abandon my editor?

We'll mark it as "no longer maintained" after 6 months of no updates. It remains available for purchase, but with a clear notice. You continue earning revenue.

### Can I build proprietary editors for clients?

Yes. You can build private editors not listed in the marketplace. Client pays you directly, they get exclusive access. No revenue share with Forge.

### Do you take a cut of client work?

No. If you're building custom editors for clients under contract, you keep 100%. Revenue share only applies to marketplace sales.
