## Content Authoring Engine

### Narrative Structure

**Hierarchical organization:**

```
Project: Epic Fantasy RPG
│
├── Act 1: The Awakening
│   ├── Chapter 1: Ordinary World
│   │   ├── Page 1: Opening cutscene
│   │   ├── Page 2: Tutorial village
│   │   └── Page 3: Meet the mentor
│   └── Chapter 2: Call to Adventure
│       ├── Page 4: Mysterious stranger arrives
│       └── Page 5: Accept the quest
│

│
└── Act 3: Resolution
    ├── Chapter 5: Final confrontation
    └── Chapter 6: Aftermath
```

**Flexible structure**

Adapt to your needs:
- **Linear stories** - Acts → Chapters → Scenes
- **Branching narratives** - Multiple paths, confluence points
- **Storylets** - Independent vignettes with prerequisites
- **Educational content** - Units → Lessons → Activities
- **Custom structures** - Define your own hierarchy

**Progress tracking**

Built-in metrics:
- Pages completed / total pages
- Chapters in progress
- Word count per act
- Estimated completion time
- Team velocity

### Character Creation

**Deep character modeling**

Each character has:

**Core attributes:**
- Name, age, appearance
- Personality traits
- Background and history
- Goals and motivations

**Relationship graph:**
```
Protagonist
├── Mentor (trusts, respects)
├── Love Interest (attracted to, conflicted)
├── Rival (competitive with, grudging respect)
└── Antagonist (opposes, fears)
```

**Dynamic relationships:**
- Track relationship values
- Change over story progression
- Impact dialogue options
- Unlock story branches

**Character context:**
- Knows what the character knows
- Tracks character's story arc
- Location and status
- Inventory and abilities

**AI-powered creation:**

Generate characters instantly:
```
Prompt: "Create a mysterious wizard mentor with a tragic past"

AI generates:
- Name and description
- Personality traits
- Backstory
- Relationship suggestions
- Sample dialogue lines
```

### Dialogue Trees

**Visual dialogue editor**

Create conversations:
- Drag-and-drop nodes
- Visual branching
- Choice consequences
- Conditional logic

**Conversation types:**

**Linear dialogue:**
```
Character A: Hello
Character B: Hi there
Character A: How are you?
Character B: I'm good, thanks
```

**Branching choices:**
```
Guard: Halt! State your business.
→ [Persuade] I'm here on official business
  Guard: Let me see your papers
    → Show forged papers [Deception > 5]
    → Show real papers
→ [Intimidate] Get out of my way
  Guard: I don't think so [Combat initiated]
→ [Charm] Just passing through, friend
  Guard: Alright, move along
```

**Storylet system:**

Independent vignettes with prerequisites:
```
Storylet: "Tavern Brawl"
Prerequisites:
  - Player in Tavern
  - Time: Evening
  - Reputation < 50
Outcomes:
  - Reputation -10
  - Unlock "Banned from Tavern" flag
```

**Dialogue features:**

- **Variables and conditions** - Gate content by story state
- **Commands** - Trigger game events from dialogue
- **Metadata** - Camera angles, animations, audio cues
- **Localization** - Multi-language support
- **Voice acting notes** - Director's comments

### Context Continuity Tracking

**Automatic context management**

Forge tracks everything:

**Story flags:**
```
Flags set:
- MetTheMentor: true
- CompletedTutorial: true
- ChosenLightPath: false
- SavedTheVillage: true
```

**Character interactions:**
```
Player → Mentor
- First meeting: Act 1, Chapter 1
- Total conversations: 7
- Relationship: 85 (Trusted Ally)
- Last seen: Act 2, Chapter 3
```

**Location history:**
```
Visited locations:
- Tutorial Village (3 times)
- Dark Forest (1 time)
- Capital City (2 times)
Currently at: Capital City
```

**Inventory and progression:**
```
Inventory:
- Mentor's Sword (equipped)
- Healing Potion x3
- Mysterious Amulet (quest item)

Quests:
- Find the Ancient Artifact (active)
- Clear the Dark Forest (complete)
- Speak to the King (available)
```

**AI context awareness:**

When generating content, AI knows:
- What the player has experienced
- Which characters they've met
- Current story state
- Available story branches
- Continuity requirements

Prevents errors like:
- Referencing unmet characters
- Repeating previous conversations
- Contradicting established facts
- Breaking logical story flow

## AI-Powered Workflows

### Content Generation

**Dialogue generation:**

```
Prompt: "Generate a tense confrontation between the protagonist and antagonist"

AI generates:
Protagonist: "You can't keep running from the truth."
Antagonist: "Truth? You wouldn't know truth if it burned your kingdom to ash."
Protagonist: "Is that a threat?"
Antagonist: "No. It's a promise."
```

**Character creation:**

```
Prompt: "Create a world-weary detective character"

AI generates:
Name: Marcus Brennan
Age: 47
Background: 20 years on the force, divorced, haunted by unsolved case
Personality: Cynical but principled, drinks too much, secretly idealistic
Relationships:
  - Former partner (deceased, guilt)
  - Rookie partner (protective, mentoring)
  - Ex-wife (complicated, lingering feelings)
```

**Story expansion:**

```
Prompt: "Add a subplot about a missing artifact"

AI suggests:
- New character: Museum curator
