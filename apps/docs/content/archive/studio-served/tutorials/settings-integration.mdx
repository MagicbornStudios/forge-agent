# Settings Integration

This tutorial shows how to wire settings in a stable order: schema, UI, store, and persistence.

## Integration sequence

1. Define settings keys and defaults.
2. Render settings UI from declarative sections.
3. Read values in editor components using scope.
4. Persist changes through the settings API.
5. Validate inheritance across app/editor/viewport scopes.

## Validation checks

- No magic setting keys
- Defaults resolve without network
- Scoped overrides do not leak across editors
- Save/load round-trip matches UI state
