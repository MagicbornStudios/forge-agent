# Forge documentation

Welcome to Forge: AI-encapsulated editors and workspaces for professional apps.

## What is Forge?

Forge is a stack and UI kit for building applications that combine:

- **Unified workspace** — Multiple sub-workspaces (e.g. graph editor, video timeline) in one shell
- **AI in context** — Copilot-style assistance with access to your current selection and draft state
- **Type-safe persistence** — Payload CMS, generated types, and a single API boundary
