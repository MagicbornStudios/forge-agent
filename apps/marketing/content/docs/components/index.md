# Component library

Forge provides a shared component set for building editor UIs.

## Key components

- **EditorShell** — Declarative root (layout and slots).
- **DockLayout** — Dockview-based panels (undock, reorder, persist).
- **DockPanel**, **PanelTabs** — Panel chrome.
- **EditorToolbar** — Toolbar with File menu, project select, and actions.

Atoms live in `@forge/ui`. Editor molecules and organisms in `@forge/shared`. See the individual component pages for API details.
