# Editors

Forge Studio includes multiple editors, each focused on a part of your narrative pipeline.

## Available editors

- **Dialogue** — Yarn Spinner–compatible dialogue graph editing (narratives and storylets).
- **Character** — Character relationship graph and voice integration.
- **Video** — Timeline-based video editing (Twick).
- **Strategy** — AI agent strategy chat (assistant-ui, tool-ui).

Each editor uses the shared EditorShell and DockLayout. See the individual guides for details.
