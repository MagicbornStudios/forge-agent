# Cursor plans

Ad-hoc plans created in Cursor. **Canonical phase work** lives in `.planning/` (ROADMAP, STATE, TASK-REGISTRY, phase folders). Use `.planning` and the phase CONTEXT/PLAN files for tracked work; update STATE, DECISIONS, and TASK-REGISTRY when completing tasks. See root AGENTS.md and docs/18-agent-artifacts-index.mdx.

Obsolete or superseded plans can be moved to `archive/` or removed.
