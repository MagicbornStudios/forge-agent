# Temporary Migration and Refactor Backlog

Use this temporary queue while migrating into Forge Loop.

## Immediate Refactors

- [ ] Inventory unstable modules and link to impacted plans
- [ ] List ownership per area (`apps/studio`, `apps/platform`, `packages/*`)
- [ ] Capture blocking technical debt that must be resolved before phase execution

## Migration Tasks

- [ ] Validate legacy import quality and parsing gaps
- [ ] Document source-of-truth transitions to `.planning`
- [ ] Track one-way legacy sync checkpoints

## Notes

- Keep this file short and actionable.
- Move completed work into phase summaries and decisions.
