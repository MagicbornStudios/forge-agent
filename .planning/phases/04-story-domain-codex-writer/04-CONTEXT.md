# Phase 04: Story domain Codex writer - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-15T01:53:36.125Z
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Build story-domain focused editing flows (outline/page/reader/diff/git) with codex scope controls and loop-safe approvals.

## Implementation Decisions

- Desired outcome: use roadmap goal as baseline.
- Constraints: none specified.
- Non-goals: none specified.

## Implementation Discretion

- Specific implementation details not explicitly constrained above.

## Deferred Ideas

- Capture new capabilities in ROADMAP instead of expanding phase scope.
