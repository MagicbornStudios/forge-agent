# Plan 15-01 — Execution summary

## What was done

- **Phase 15 created** and added to ROADMAP (Strategic shift — Repo Studio + Platform focus).
- **Context and PRD** written: `.planning/phases/15-strategic-shift-repo-studio-platform-focus/15-CONTEXT.md`, `15-PRD.md`.
- **Master plan** written: `15-01-PLAN.md` — full scope of the shift (archive Studio app; Character and Dialogue to extensions repo; consumer-studio as extension; platform deprecate forge graphs and Yarn Spinner; platform Repo Studio–first).
- **Decisions** logged in `.planning/DECISIONS.md` (2026-02-26): archive Studio, Character/Dialogue to extensions, consumer-studio as extension, platform deprecations, primary product focus.
- **Tasks** registered in `.planning/TASK-REGISTRY.md`: FRG-1501–FRG-1510 (archive, extract Character/Dialogue, consumer-studio extension, platform docs, plan 01 documentation pass).
- **STATE.md** updated: Phase 15, Plan 15-01, status Planning/discussion; strategic shift section added.
- **ROADMAP.md** updated: Phase 15 section with 15-01 and placeholder for 15-02+; Progress table row for Phase 15.

## Next steps

1. **Loops of discussion** — Use 15-01-PLAN.md as the basis for discuss → plan cycles. Adjust execution order, task breakdown, or extension repo layout as needed.
2. **Implementation plans** — After discussion stabilizes, add 15-02, 15-03, … for: archive Studio app; extensions repo setup; extract Character; extract Dialogue; consumer-studio extension; platform deprecation docs and Repo Studio support.
3. **Run sync-legacy** — After any loop output that changes .planning, run `forge-loop sync-legacy` to update legacy snapshots in docs/agent-artifacts/core.

## Traceability

- ROADMAP → Phase 15 → this phase folder → 15-01-PLAN.md, 15-PRD.md, 15-CONTEXT.md.
- DECISIONS.md → 2026-02-26 (Phase 15 strategic shift).
- TASK-REGISTRY.md → FRG-1501–FRG-1510.
