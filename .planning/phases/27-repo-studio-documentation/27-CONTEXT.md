# Phase 27: Repo Studio documentation

## Purpose

Dedicated phase for **comprehensive Repo Studio documentation**. Heavy documentation effort: what Repo Studio does, how to install, how to extend it, packages available for download. **Downloadable from docs site:** Repo Studio desktop app and packages should be discoverable and downloadable from the docs site. Install instructions, extension authoring, concept workspace, planning workflow — all documented clearly. Target: users and extension authors can understand and adopt Repo Studio without digging through code.

## Scope

- **Docs site as hub:** Repo Studio downloadable from docs site; packages available for download; clear install instructions.
- **What Repo Studio does:** Overview, workspaces (Planning, Code, Git, Database, Extensions, Concept simulation), assistant, terminal, desktop vs web.
- **How to extend:** Extension manifest, workspace kinds, install flow, src downloadable for edit-in-place; reference to repo-studio-extensions.
- **Packages:** Document @forge/repo-studio, @forge/repo-studio-extension-adapters, shared packages; when to use each; install from npm or monorepo.

## Dependencies

- Phase 25 (Concept workspace) and extension model should be stable. Can overlap with later phases.

## Key documents

- **27-01-PLAN.md** — TBD: Docs site structure, Repo Studio download/install docs, package docs.
- **27-02-PLAN.md** — TBD: Extension authoring guide, how to extend concept workspace.
