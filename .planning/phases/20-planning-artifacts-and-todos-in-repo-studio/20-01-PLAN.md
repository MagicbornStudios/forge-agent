# Plan 20-01: DoD and HUMAN-TASKS in snapshot and panels

## Goal

Add **DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md** and **HUMAN-TASKS.md** to the planning snapshot (coreFiles in `collectPlanningDocs`) so they are loaded and available to the Planning workspace. Add a **DoD panel** (or section) and a **Human TODOs panel** so users can view and open these artifacts without leaving the workspace.

## Scope

- **repo-data.ts:** Extend `coreFiles` in [apps/repo-studio/src/lib/repo-data.ts](../../../apps/repo-studio/src/lib/repo-data.ts) to include `DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md` and `HUMAN-TASKS.md`. Ensure snapshot shape exposes them (e.g. as planning docs with ids `core:DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md`, `core:HUMAN-TASKS.md`).
- **DoD panel:** New panel (or section in an existing panel) that displays DoD content and/or links to the doc; follow existing panel pattern (e.g. PrdPanel, StatusPanel). May be read-only view + "Open in viewport" action.
- **Human TODOs panel:** New panel that displays HUMAN-TASKS.md content (or parsed items if we add light parsing later). Optional: badge/count in rail for open human tasks.

## Out of scope

- Full parsing of DoD or HUMAN-TASKS into structured models (can be a later enhancement).
- Unified "my todos | agent tasks" view (20-02).
- On-load assistant prompt (20-03).

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-2001 | Add DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md and HUMAN-TASKS.md to coreFiles in repo-data collectPlanningDocs; ensure snapshot includes them | Pending |
| FRG-2002 | Add DoD panel (or DoD section) in Planning workspace; display DoD content / link to doc | Pending |
| FRG-2003 | Add Human TODOs panel; display HUMAN-TASKS content; optional rail badge for open human task count | Pending |

## Done criteria

- Both artifacts are in the planning snapshot and visible in the UI.
- User can open DoD and Human TODOs from the Planning workspace without editing repo-data by hand.
