# Plan 20-03: On-load planning prompt and optional notifications

## Goal

When the user opens the **Planning workspace**, optionally **open the assistant** and send a **planning-focused prompt** (e.g. "What should we work on next?" or "Review current state and suggest next steps") to Codex so the assistant can discuss what to do without the user typing first. Optionally add **tagging or notifications** for human-blocked items (e.g. rail badge when HUMAN-TASKS has open items).

## Scope

- **On-load behavior:** On Planning workspace mount (or first focus), optionally: open assistant panel if closed, switch to Codex if not already, send a system or user message that triggers a planning "what to do" response. Make this **configurable** (e.g. setting or feature flag) so we don’t force the behavior on every load.
- **Tagging/notifications:** Optional: badge or indicator when HUMAN-TASKS has open (incomplete) items; could be in rail, or in the Human TODOs panel header. Document in DECISIONS if deferred.

## Out of scope

- Changing shared AssistantPanel contract (only Repo Studio Planning workspace behavior).
- Mandatory auto-send on every load without a way to disable.

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-2006 | Optional: On Planning workspace load, open assistant and send planning "what to do" prompt to Codex; make configurable (setting/flag); document in DECISIONS | Pending |
| FRG-2007 | Optional: Badge or notification when HUMAN-TASKS has open items; document in DECISIONS if deferred | Pending |

## Done criteria

- If implemented: user can enable "planning welcome" and get an initial Codex response on opening Planning workspace.
- Deferrals and design choices (e.g. "no auto-open by default") documented in DECISIONS.
