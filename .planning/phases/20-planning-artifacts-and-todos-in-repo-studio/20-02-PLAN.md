# Plan 20-02: Unified "My todos | Agent tasks" view

## Goal

Provide a **unified view** that shows "my todos" (from HUMAN-TASKS.md) alongside "agent tasks" (from TASK-REGISTRY) with **correlation** so users and the assistant can see when an agent task is blocked by a human task (e.g. "FRG-1803 blocked by HT-04").

## Scope

- **Data:** Use existing planning snapshot (after 20-01, HUMAN-TASKS and TASK-REGISTRY are both loaded). Optionally add light parsing to extract HUMAN-TASKS items (e.g. HT-xx) and task-registry rows; correlate via text (e.g. "blocked by HT-04" in task notes) or structured links if we introduce them.
- **UI:** Single panel or tabbed section: "My todos" (human) | "Agent tasks" (TASK-REGISTRY). Show correlation: e.g. badge or label on agent task "Blocked by HT-04" with link to HUMAN-TASKS.
- **Assistant:** Ensure assistant context (Phase 19) can reference both HUMAN-TASKS and TASK-REGISTRY; plan tools (add_task, update_task_status) remain agent-task focused; optional tool or prompt hint for "list human blockers."

## Out of scope

- Editing HUMAN-TASKS from the UI (remain file-based in .planning).
- Full two-way sync between HUMAN-TASKS and TASK-REGISTRY.

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-2004 | Unified view: "My todos" (HUMAN-TASKS) and "Agent tasks" (TASK-REGISTRY) in one panel or tabbed section | Pending |
| FRG-2005 | Correlation: show "blocked by HT-xx" (or similar) on agent tasks when referenced in notes/spec | Pending |

## Done criteria

- User can see human todos and agent tasks in one place with clear correlation where applicable.
- Assistant and plan tools can leverage the same snapshot; optional: document "list human blockers" in Forge contract or DECISIONS.
