# Plan 25-01: Game simulation workspace extension

## Goal

Implement the **game simulation workspace** as an extension workspace: register the workspace, provide its own **parser** and **write path** for docs, tree + viewport similar to Planning, **fixed naming**, project folder **`.concept`**, and a **simulation entry point** (e.g. `agent.md`) that Codex uses to run the DM-style simulation.

## Scope

- **Workspace registration:** Add "game simulation" to workspace catalog / extension adapters; workspace works in a project folder (e.g. repo root or a designated path) containing `.concept`.
- **Parser and doc writes:** Own parser for game/simulation docs (GRD, .concept files); create/update files with conventions that display well in the workspace (similar to Planning).
- **UI:** Tree + viewport; list and open docs; fixed naming so tree and panels show consistent structure.
- **`.concept`:** Project folder the workspace operates on; simulation content (entry point, scenes, state) lives here.
- **Entry point:** Define and wire simulation entry point (e.g. `agent.md` or config) so Codex can be pointed at it for simulation runs.

## Out of scope

- Scoping the assistant to workspace-only context during simulation (25-02).
- Two-loop handoff implementation (25-02).
- Changing Phase 24 loop model (only consume its naming).

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-2501 | Register game simulation workspace in catalog/extension adapters; define workspace id and .concept path | Pending |
| FRG-2502 | Implement or adopt parser for game/simulation docs; define write path and file naming for display | Pending |
| FRG-2503 | Tree + viewport UI for game simulation (reuse Planning-like pattern); fixed naming in tree | Pending |
| FRG-2504 | Define simulation entry point (e.g. agent.md) and document for Codex/skills | Pending |

## Done criteria

- Game simulation workspace appears in Repo Studio; can open and edit docs in .concept; entry point identified for Codex simulation.

## Reference

- Use `.tmp/dungeonbreak-docs-reference/` (after `pnpm reference:copy-dungeonbreak`) for structure and naming ideas; do not edit our .planning from that copy.
