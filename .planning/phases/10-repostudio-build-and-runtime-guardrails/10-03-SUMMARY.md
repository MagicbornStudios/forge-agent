# Phase 10: RepoStudio build and runtime guardrails - Plan 03 Summary

**Generated by forge-loop execute-phase**

## Tasks
- [x] 01. Add predev guard for RepoStudio startup
- [x] 02. Update RepoStudio runbooks for pre-dev checks
- [x] 03. Update loop artifacts and traceability

## Implementation Notes

- Added root script:
  - `predev:repo-studio`: `pnpm forge-repo-studio doctor`
- Existing `dev:repo-studio` remains:
  - `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app dev`
- Result: local dev startup now fails early when doctor detects missing RepoStudio dependencies.

## Documentation Updates

- Updated `packages/repo-studio/docs/01-quickstart.md` with fail-fast startup flow and remediation commands.
- Updated `packages/repo-studio/README.md` with precheck behavior and install/doctor/build remediation sequence.

## Verification Evidence

- `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app build` PASS.
- `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app lint` PASS.
- `pnpm forge-repo-studio doctor --json` PASS with dependency diagnostics fields present.
