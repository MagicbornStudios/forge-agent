# Phase 10: RepoStudio build and runtime guardrails - Plan 02 Summary

**Generated by forge-loop execute-phase**

## Tasks
- [x] 01. Add CSS package resolvability checks to dependency-health modules
- [x] 02. Propagate updated health contract to doctor/API/UI types
- [x] 03. Update loop artifacts and traceability

## Implementation Notes

- Extended dependency health contracts in both:
  - `packages/repo-studio/src/lib/dependency-health.mjs`
  - `apps/repo-studio/src/lib/dependency-health.ts`
- Added new fields:
  - `cssPackagesResolved`
  - `cssPackageStatus[]` containing `packageName`, `resolved`, `resolvedPath`.
- Required CSS packages checked:
  - `tw-animate-css`
  - `tailwindcss-animate`
- Updated diagnostics consumers:
  - `packages/repo-studio/src/commands/doctor.mjs`
  - `apps/repo-studio/app/api/repo/runtime/deps/route.ts`
  - `apps/repo-studio/src/lib/api/types.ts`
  - `apps/repo-studio/src/components/features/env/EnvWorkspace.tsx`

## Verification Evidence

- `pnpm forge-repo-studio doctor --json` now reports `cssPackagesResolved` and per-package status.
- Added test `packages/repo-studio/src/__tests__/dependency-health.test.mjs` validating unresolved CSS package detection.
- `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio test` passed with new dependency-health coverage.
- `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app build` passed without new dependency-health warnings.
