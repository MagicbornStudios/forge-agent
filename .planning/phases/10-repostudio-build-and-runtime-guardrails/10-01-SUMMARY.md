# Phase 10: RepoStudio build and runtime guardrails - Plan 01 Summary

**Generated by forge-loop execute-phase**

## Tasks
- [x] 01. Add RepoStudio path gate to verification command plan
- [x] 02. Add integration tests for RepoStudio verification gate
- [x] 03. Update loop artifacts and traceability

## Implementation Notes

- Added `shouldRunRepoStudioBuild(changedFiles)` in `packages/forge-loop/src/commands/verify-work.mjs`.
- Verification command plan now appends `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app build` when changed files include:
  - `apps/repo-studio/**`
  - `packages/repo-studio/**`
- Existing command matrix behavior for non-RepoStudio paths remains unchanged.

## Verification Evidence

- `pnpm --filter @forge/forge-loop test` passed with new assertions.
- Added integration tests in `packages/forge-loop/src/__tests__/verify-work.integration.test.mjs` for:
  - no RepoStudio build command on unrelated paths
  - RepoStudio build command on RepoStudio app path changes
- `pnpm forge-loop verify-work 10 --strict --non-interactive` showed explicit PASS for:
  - `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app build`
