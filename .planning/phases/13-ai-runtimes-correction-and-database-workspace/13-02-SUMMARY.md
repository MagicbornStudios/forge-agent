# Phase 13: AI runtimes correction and Database workspace - Plan 02 Summary

**Generated by forge-loop execute-phase**

## Tasks
- [x] 01. Add drizzle.config.ts in apps/repo-studio (same DB as Payload: REPO_STUDIO_DATABASE_URI or file:./data/repo-studio.db)
- [x] 02. Add drizzle/schema.ts (minimal; run db:pull to introspect and regenerate)
- [x] 03. Add db:pull and db:studio scripts; drizzle-kit and drizzle-orm as devDependencies
- [x] 04. Replace DatabaseWorkspace content with embedded Drizzle Studio iframe (port 4983) and hint bar
- [x] 05. Remove POST /api/repo/db/query route, better-sqlite3 from package.json and next.config serverExternalPackages

## Outcomes
- Database workspace now embeds Drizzle Studio (iframe to http://127.0.0.1:4983). User runs `pnpm db:studio` to start the studio server; `pnpm db:pull` once to introspect the DB and generate schema.
- Custom SQL runner and better-sqlite3 removed. Layout/panel/menu for Database workspace unchanged.
