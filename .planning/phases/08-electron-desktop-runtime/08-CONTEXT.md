# Phase 08: Electron desktop runtime - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-17T02:33:15.764Z
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Provide Electron runtime with bundled SQLite and native watcher-first repository refresh behavior.

## Implementation Decisions

- Desired outcome: Phase 08 clean-code cut: embedded Next server desktop mode, electron-builder packaging scaffold, native watcher with polling fallback, shared sqlite path resolver.
- Constraints: none specified.
- Non-goals: none specified.

## Implementation Discretion

- Specific implementation details not explicitly constrained above.

## Deferred Ideas

- Capture new capabilities in ROADMAP instead of expanding phase scope.
