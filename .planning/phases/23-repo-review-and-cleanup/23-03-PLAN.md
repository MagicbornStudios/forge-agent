# Plan 23-03: Repo layout and legacy cleanup

## Goal

Document expected repo layout in one place; clarify app vs apps (monorepo); document vendor/submodules/extensions/platform, docs vs apps/docs, legacy and docs/agent-artifacts; add .cursor/plans hygiene (archive or note that .planning is canonical).

## Scope

- **Expected layout:** Single source of truth (e.g. new section in AGENTS.md or 18-agent-artifacts-index): root contains `.planning/`, `apps/`, `packages/`, `vendor/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`; no top-level `app`; vendor = submodules + vendored deps; extensions in vendor/repo-studio-extensions and .repo-studio/extensions per project; platform = separate repo, future submodule at vendor/platform.
- **App wording:** Grep and fix docs that imply a single "app" at root; clarify "apps/* = monorepo apps; Repo Studio = primary app."
- **Legacy and snapshots:** Confirm docs/agent-artifacts is read-only snapshot; legacy/ or archived apps documented as archived; no duplicate source of truth.
- **.cursor/plans:** List .cursor/plans; add note (e.g. README or in docs) that Cursor plans are ad-hoc and .planning is canonical for phase work; optionally move obsolete plans to .cursor/plans/archive/.

## Out of scope

- Moving or deleting apps/packages (only documentation and .cursor/plans hygiene).
