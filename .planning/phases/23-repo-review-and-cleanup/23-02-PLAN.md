# Plan 23-02: Analysis consolidation

## Goal

Review analysis folders and ANALYSIS-LOOPS/ANALYSIS-REFERENCES; decide consolidate vs archive vs keep (trim); document "why it was like that" and how analysis ties to the single Forge Loop. Update references so phases and DECISIONS point to the right places.

## Scope

- **Audit:** List every analysis folder and key files at repo root and under .planning; compare to ANALYSIS-LOOPS and ANALYSIS-REFERENCES; note which are still referenced by phases and which are obsolete or redundant.
- **Decide model:** Choose one of: (a) Consolidate — merge into a single analysis doc or small set under `.planning/analysis/` or `docs/`; (b) Archive — move completed/redundant analysis into docs/agent-artifacts or .planning/archive and update references; (c) Keep but trim — keep separate loops, one focus per folder, document "why this split" in ANALYSIS-LOOPS.
- **Update references:** Rewrite or shorten ANALYSIS-LOOPS.md and .planning/ANALYSIS-REFERENCES.md to match the chosen model; ensure .planning phases and DECISIONS point to the right places.
- **Document:** Add "Analysis and loops" section (e.g. in DECISIONS or .planning) explaining the chosen structure and how it ties to the single Forge Loop (.planning + GSD/Codex + Repo Studio).

## Out of scope

- Deleting or moving analysis folders without a decided model (23-02 tasks can be audit + doc first; archive/move in a follow-up if model is archive).

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-2304 | Audit: list analysis folders and files; compare to ANALYSIS-LOOPS and ANALYSIS-REFERENCES; note referenced vs obsolete | Pending |
| FRG-2305 | Decide model (consolidate/archive/trim); update ANALYSIS-LOOPS and ANALYSIS-REFERENCES; document in DECISIONS | Pending |

## Done criteria

- Audit recorded; model decided and documented; ANALYSIS-LOOPS and ANALYSIS-REFERENCES updated; DECISIONS or .planning doc explains analysis and single loop.
