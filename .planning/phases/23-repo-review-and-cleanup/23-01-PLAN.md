# Plan 23-01: GSD install and Cursor alignment

## Goal

Ensure get-shit-done (GSD) is installable for Codex in this repo and Cursor agents follow the same phase workflow (`.planning` as source of truth, forge-loop for doctor/progress/sync-legacy). No duplicate slash-command surface—Cursor uses the same artifact contract.

## Scope

- **Verify/run install:** Ensure `pnpm gsd:install` works from repo root and creates/updates `.codex/` (skills, workflows). Add `.codex/` to `.gitignore` so local install is not committed.
- **Cursor rule/skill:** Add a Cursor rule that points to `.planning` (ROADMAP, STATE, TASK-REGISTRY, DECISIONS, phases), references `forge-loop doctor`, `forge-loop progress`, `forge-loop sync-legacy` and when to run them, and for phase work says: read CONTEXT and PLANs, update STATE/DECISIONS/TASK-REGISTRY as in GSD workflow.
- **Docs:** Short note in docs (e.g. 18-agent-artifacts-index or a how-to): "Using Cursor with this repo: run `pnpm gsd:install` so Codex (when used) has GSD; in Cursor, follow AGENTS.md and .planning; use forge-loop for doctor/progress/sync-legacy."

## Out of scope

- Changing vendor/get-shit-done internals.
- Adding Cursor slash commands that duplicate GSD; Cursor follows the artifact contract only.

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-2301 | Add .codex/ to .gitignore; verify pnpm gsd:install runs and populates .codex/ | Pending |
| FRG-2302 | Add Cursor rule: .planning source of truth, forge-loop doctor/progress/sync-legacy, phase workflow | Pending |
| FRG-2303 | Document "Using Cursor with this repo" in 18-agent-artifacts-index or how-to | Pending |

## Done criteria

- .codex/ is gitignored; pnpm gsd:install works. Cursor rule exists; doc note exists for Cursor users.
