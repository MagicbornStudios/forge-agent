# Plan 17-01: Add Platform submodule and verify

## Goal

Add [MagicbornStudios/RepoStudio-Platform](https://github.com/MagicbornStudios/RepoStudio-Platform) as a submodule in forge-agent at **vendor/platform**, update .gitmodules and the release workflow to init it, and verify that the submodule can be cloned and that the platform build can run (from submodule or from the platform repo).

## Scope

- Add submodule at **`vendor/platform`** (alongside vendor/repo-studio-extensions, vendor/get-shit-done, and vendor/repo-studio when present).
- Update **.gitmodules** with the new submodule entry.
- Update **release workflow** ([.github/workflows/release-repo-studio-desktop.yml](../../../.github/workflows/release-repo-studio-desktop.yml)) to init vendor/platform in the verify job (and optionally package_windows if platform build is run there).
- **Verification:** Repo exists on GitHub; `git submodule update --init vendor/platform` works; platform build can run from submodule (if workspace is extended) or from RepoStudio-Platform repo. Do **not** yet remove in-repo apps/platform; that is 17-03/17-07.

## Out of scope (17-03, 17-07)

- Removing or archiving apps/platform from forge-agent.
- Changing release workflow to build platform from vendor/platform (or dropping platform build from forge-agent); that is 17-04.

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-1701 | Add submodule: `git submodule add https://github.com/MagicbornStudios/RepoStudio-Platform.git vendor/platform`; update .gitmodules | Pending |
| FRG-1702 | Release workflow: init vendor/platform in verify job (and optionally build platform from submodule or document that platform build is in its repo) | Pending |
| FRG-1703 | Verify: Platform submodule clone and build (from submodule or from RepoStudio-Platform repo) | Pending |

## Done criteria

- Submodule vendor/platform added and .gitmodules updated.
- Release workflow inits vendor/platform.
- Verification completed and recorded.
- In-repo apps/platform remains for now (removal in 17-07).
