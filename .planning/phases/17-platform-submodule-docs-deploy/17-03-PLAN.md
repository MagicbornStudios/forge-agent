# Plan 17-03: Platform deploy from its repo

## Goal

Document and enable platform deploy to Vercel from the RepoStudio-Platform repo. Platform must have `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_APP_URL` (and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_APP_URL` if used) set in Vercel to the live docs (and studio) URLs. Once platform submodule is integrated and release/verify gates updated, remove or archive in-repo [apps/platform](../../../apps/platform) from forge-agent (or keep verify gate building from vendor/platform when present).

## Scope

- Document that RepoStudio-Platform deploys to **Vercel from that repo** (not from forge-agent). Platform repo has its own CI/deploy; Vercel project is connected to MagicbornStudios/RepoStudio-Platform.
- Platform Vercel env: **NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_APP_URL** = deployed docs site URL (from forge-agent, recorded in 17-02). **NEXT_PUBLIC_STUDIO_APP_URL** if platform links to Studio/Repo Studio.
- Decision: After submodule is canonical, **remove or archive apps/platform** from forge-agent and update release workflow and guards to use vendor/platform or skip platform build in forge-agent (see 17-04 / FRG-1707).

## Out of scope

- Actual Vercel project creation (document steps only).
- Deployment matrix one-pager (17-04).

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-1706 | Document platform Vercel deploy from RepoStudio-Platform repo; env NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_APP_URL (and related) set to docs site URL | Pending |
| FRG-1707 | Remove or archive apps/platform from forge-agent once platform submodule is canonical; update release workflow and guards to use vendor/platform or skip platform build in forge-agent | Pending |

## Done criteria

- Platform deploy from its repo documented; env matrix clear.
- In-repo apps/platform removed or archived; release workflow and guards updated (17-07).
