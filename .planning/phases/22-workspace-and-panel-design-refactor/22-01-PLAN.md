# Plan 22-01: Chat-in-chat (remove Copy @ from panels)

## Goal

Remove or replace **Copy @ token** (and similar attach/reference buttons) from panels so that attach/reference actions live only in the **assistant chat input** (composer). Document in DECISIONS that @-mentions are the single place of truth for referencing planning docs (and similar) in the assistant.

## Scope

- **PlanningPanel** and **PlanningDocumentsPanel**: Remove "Copy @ token" and "Open in Assistant" (or equivalent) buttons; optionally add a short hint (e.g. "Use @ in the assistant to reference docs") in panel header or empty state.
- **panelContext:** Remove or deprecate `onCopyMentionToken` from workspace/panel contract if no longer needed; ensure assistant composer supports @-mention suggestions for planning docs (or document as follow-up).
- **DECISIONS:** Add entry that attach/reference is chat-in-chat only; no per-panel Copy @ or duplicate attach buttons.

## Out of scope

- Changing shared AssistantPanel or composer UI (only removal of panel-side buttons and contract cleanup).
- Adding new @-mention types; only documenting and enforcing the existing rule.

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-2201 | Remove Copy @ token and Open in Assistant (or equivalent) buttons from PlanningPanel and PlanningDocumentsPanel | Pending |
| FRG-2202 | Remove or deprecate onCopyMentionToken from panelContext/workspace types if unused; add DECISIONS entry for chat-in-chat | Pending |

## Done criteria

- No Copy @ or duplicate attach buttons in planning panels; DECISIONS records chat-in-chat as the rule.
