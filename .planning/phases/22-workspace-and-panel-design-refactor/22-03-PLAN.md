# Plan 22-03: Tree as primary (context menu for structure actions)

## Goal

Use **tree as primary** navigation for file/doc-like content; add **context menu** (and optional tree toolbar) for structure-changing actions (New file, New folder, Rename, etc.) instead of scattering creation UI across panels. Apply to Story workspace and/or Planning Documents tree where agreed.

## Scope

- **Story workspace:** Consider replacing or supplementing the Act/Chapter/Page table with a tree; add context menu on folder/node for "New file", "New folder", or domain-equivalent actions. If table remains, add context menu on rows where applicable.
- **Planning Documents:** PlanningDocListPanel already uses a tree; add context menu for structure actions if applicable (e.g. "Open in viewport", or read-only with open only; new file/folder may be out of scope for .planning without explicit product decision).
- **General rule:** Document in DECISIONS or styling doc that structure actions live on the tree (context menu / toolbar), not in separate panels or cards.

## Out of scope

- Backend or API for creating planning files (unless already present); focus on UI placement and context menu wiring.
- Graph viewport or non-tree workspaces.

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-2205 | Add context menu to tree panel(s): structure actions (e.g. New file, Open) where applicable; Story and/or Planning Documents | Pending |
| FRG-2206 | Optional: Story workspace — tree-based navigation instead of or in addition to table; document in DECISIONS | Pending |

## Done criteria

- Tree panels expose context menu for relevant actions; no duplicate creation UI scattered in other panels. Optional: Story uses tree for navigation.
