# Plan 22-02: Panel discipline (reduce Planning left rail)

## Goal

Reduce the **Planning workspace left rail** from seven panels to fewer, purpose-driven panels via **grouping**, **tabs**, or **collapse**. Align with Phase 21 artifact layout decisions if available (e.g. Overview vs Work groups).

## Scope

- **Options:** (a) Group related panels into one panel with internal tabs (e.g. "Overview" = PRD + Status + Decisions; "Work" = Phases + Tasks + Documents). (b) Collapse less-used panels by default; expose via View > Layout. (c) Two-level left rail (e.g. two tabbed groups). Choose approach that fits "panel discipline" (max or grouping contract from styling doc).
- **app-spec.generated.ts:** Layout definitions may change (fewer panel ids or new grouped panel ids); ensure codegen and workspace component stay in sync.
- **PlanningWorkspace.tsx:** Update panel composition to match chosen grouping; preserve viewport and assistant.

## Out of scope

- Changing viewport or assistant placement.
- Other workspaces (Code, Git, etc.) unless they share the same contract.

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-2203 | Decide grouping approach (tabs, collapse, or two-level rail) per Phase 21 artifact layout if done; document in DECISIONS | Pending |
| FRG-2204 | Refactor Planning left rail: implement grouping/tabs/collapse; update layout definitions and PlanningWorkspace | Pending |

## Done criteria

- Planning left rail has fewer visible panels (e.g. 3–4 or grouped); layout remains usable and consistent with workspace and panel composition rules.
