# Plan 24-01: Loop hierarchy and naming

## Goal

Document **when to create child loops** (new scope = new loop; scope growth → loop becomes child of a meta loop). Define **fixed naming conventions** for GRD/PRD and loop folders so Repo Studio and coding agents can reliably discover loop docs. Ensure LOOPS.json and `.planning/loops/<loopId>/` are the single source of truth for discoverability.

## Scope

- Loop hierarchy: document rule "new product/scope = new loop"; when a meta loop exists (e.g. monorepo PRD), child loops (e.g. Next.js app, game) live under it with separate loop IDs.
- Naming: fixed conventions for loop docs (e.g. GRD-*.md, PRD.md, or equivalent) and loop folder names; document in DECISIONS or phase CONTEXT.
- Discoverability: LOOPS.json and `.planning/loops/<loopId>/` layout; how Repo Studio and agents resolve planning root and list loops (already in repo-data.ts; document and align with naming).

## Out of scope

- Implementing the Game simulation workspace (Phase 25).
- Changing how Phase 21 artifact layout groups panels (only align naming so layout can reference same doc names).

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-2401 | Document loop hierarchy rule and child/meta loop relationship in DECISIONS or 24-CONTEXT | Pending |
| FRG-2402 | Define and document fixed naming conventions for GRD/PRD and loop-related docs | Pending |
| FRG-2403 | Confirm LOOPS.json and .planning/loops/<loopId> discoverability and document in phase or repo-data comments | Pending |

## Done criteria

- Hierarchy and naming decisions recorded; Phase 25 and Repo Studio can rely on fixed names and loop index for discovery.
