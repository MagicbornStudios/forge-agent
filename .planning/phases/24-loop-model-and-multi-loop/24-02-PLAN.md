# Plan 24-02: Max doc size and summarize/archive

## Goal

Define **max size** for key planning docs and **contextual summarize and archive** behavior. Wire or document existing mechanisms (user indicated something like this may already be in place but not done).

## Scope

- Max size: define limits (e.g. character or section count) for key docs (PRD, GRD, STATE, TASK-REGISTRY, or phase PLANs) so context stays bounded.
- Summarize/archive: when a doc exceeds max size, contextual summarization and archiving (e.g. move older sections to archive, keep summary in main doc); document or implement.
- Locate any existing "max size" or "summarize/archive" design in the repo and complete or document it.

## Out of scope

- Changing Phase 25 game simulation workspace doc format (that phase has its own parser).
- Enforcing max size in real time in UI (can be a later enhancement); this plan is design + doc or baseline implementation.

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-2404 | Search repo for existing max-size or summarize/archive design; document in DECISIONS or this phase | Pending |
| FRG-2405 | Define max size for key planning docs and document in DECISIONS or 24-CONTEXT | Pending |
| FRG-2406 | Document or implement contextual summarize/archive behavior when limit exceeded | Pending |

## Done criteria

- Max size and summarize/archive behavior defined and either implemented or clearly documented for future implementation.
