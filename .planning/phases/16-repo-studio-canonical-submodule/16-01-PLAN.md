# Plan 16-01: Add Repo Studio submodule and verify

## Goal

Add [MagicbornStudios/RepoStudio](https://github.com/MagicbornStudios/RepoStudio) as a submodule in forge-agent and verify that (a) it is present on GitHub, (b) it can be pulled down in the monorepo, and (c) the monorepo can build with the submodule (so we are ready to switch to canonical in 16-02).

## Scope

- Add submodule at **`vendor/repo-studio`** (alongside `vendor/repo-studio-extensions`, `vendor/get-shit-done`).
- Update **.gitmodules** with the new submodule entry.
- Update **release workflow** to init the new submodule in both jobs (verify + package_windows).
- **Verification:** After add, confirm: repo exists on GitHub; `git submodule update --init vendor/repo-studio` works; with submodule present, monorepo install + build (e.g. `pnpm install`, `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app build` or equivalent) succeeds. Do **not** yet change where the desktop build reads the app from (still use in-repo `apps/repo-studio` / `packages/repo-studio` for Phase 1).

## Out of scope (16-02)

- Building the desktop app from the submodule.
- Removing or repointing in-repo `apps/repo-studio` and `packages/repo-studio`.
- Changing [next-server.mjs](packages/repo-studio/src/desktop/next-server.mjs) or [build.mjs](packages/repo-studio/src/desktop/build.mjs) app root resolution.

## Tasks

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| FRG-1601 | Add submodule: `git submodule add https://github.com/MagicbornStudios/RepoStudio.git vendor/repo-studio`; update .gitmodules | Pending |
| FRG-1602 | Update [.github/workflows/release-repo-studio-desktop.yml](.github/workflows/release-repo-studio-desktop.yml): init `vendor/repo-studio` in verify and package_windows jobs | Pending |
| FRG-1603 | Verify: Repo exists on GitHub and is pullable; document in phase or DECISIONS | Pending |
| FRG-1604 | Verify: `git submodule update --init vendor/repo-studio` works from a fresh clone | Pending |
| FRG-1605 | Verify: With submodule present, `pnpm install` and Repo Studio app build (and optional desktop package step) succeed in monorepo | Pending |
| FRG-1606 | Document in README or docs: Repo Studio app canonical source is MagicbornStudios/RepoStudio; included as submodule at vendor/repo-studio | Pending |

## Done criteria

- Submodule added and .gitmodules updated.
- Release workflow inits vendor/repo-studio.
- Verification checklist above completed and recorded.
- No change yet to build-from path (canonical switch is 16-02).
