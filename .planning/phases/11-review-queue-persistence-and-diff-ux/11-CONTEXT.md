# Phase 11: Review Queue persistence and diff UX - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-17T06:10:50.312Z
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Make Review Queue production-grade with SQLite-backed proposals, one-file-at-a-time Monaco diff UX, and scope-safe trust-mode auto-apply.

## Implementation Decisions

- Desired outcome: use roadmap goal as baseline.
- Constraints: none specified.
- Non-goals: none specified.

## Implementation Discretion

- Specific implementation details not explicitly constrained above.

## Deferred Ideas

- Capture new capabilities in ROADMAP instead of expanding phase scope.
