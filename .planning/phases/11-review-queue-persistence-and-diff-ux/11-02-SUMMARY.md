# Phase 11: Review Queue persistence and diff UX - Plan 02 Summary

**Generated by forge-loop execute-phase**

## Tasks
- [x] 01. Add proposal unified-diff parser
- [x] 02. Add proposal diff APIs
- [x] 03. Extend typed client contracts

## Implementation Notes

- Added proposal diff parser at `apps/repo-studio/src/lib/proposals/diff-parser.ts` with deterministic extraction of:
  - file path
  - status
  - additions/deletions
  - hunk count
  - per-file unified patch payload
- Added new routes:
  - `GET /api/repo/proposals/diff-files`
  - `GET /api/repo/proposals/diff-file`
- Extended typed client contracts in `apps/repo-studio/src/lib/api/types.ts` and service methods in `apps/repo-studio/src/lib/api/services/proposals.ts`.

## Verification Evidence

- `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app build`
- `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app run test:review-queue`
