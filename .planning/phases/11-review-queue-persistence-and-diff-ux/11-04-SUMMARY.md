# Phase 11: Review Queue persistence and diff UX - Plan 04 Summary

**Generated by forge-loop execute-phase**

## Tasks
- [x] 01. Add proposal persistence and diff parser regression tests
- [x] 02. Update runbooks and README with trust/migration behavior
- [x] 03. Run strict verification and publish phase summaries

## Implementation Notes

- Added review-queue regression tests:
  - `apps/repo-studio/__tests__/review-queue/proposal-diff-parser.test.mjs`
  - `apps/repo-studio/__tests__/review-queue/proposal-store.test.mjs`
- Added app test script:
  - `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app run test:review-queue`
- Updated runbooks/README to document:
  - SQLite proposal persistence (`repo-proposals`)
  - one-time JSON import + read-only fallback semantics
  - trust mode behavior and scope-guard invariants in auto mode

## Verification Evidence

- `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app lint`
- `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app run test:settings-codegen`
- `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app run test:repo-search`
- `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio-app run test:review-queue`
- `pnpm --filter @forge/repo-studio test`
