## Implementation Decisions

- Desired outcome: use roadmap goal as baseline.
- Constraints: none specified.
- Non-goals: none specified.

## Implementation Discretion

- Specific implementation details not explicitly constrained above.

## Deferred Ideas

- Capture new capabilities in ROADMAP instead of expanding phase scope.
