# Default loop — Product intent

Repo-wide product intent for the default planning loop (`.planning/`). We ship **Repo Studio** as the primary product, backed by the **platform**, with loops and planning artifacts for multi-agent orchestration (Codex, Claude Code, and others). Strategic direction and stage conventions live in the linked docs below.

## Pointers

- **Strategic shift and scope:** [.planning/phases/15-strategic-shift-repo-studio-platform-focus/15-PRD.md](.planning/phases/15-strategic-shift-repo-studio-platform-focus/15-PRD.md)
- **Platform:** [.planning/PLATFORM-PRD.md](.planning/PLATFORM-PRD.md)
- **Monetization (iteration):** [.planning/MONETIZATION-STRATEGY.md](.planning/MONETIZATION-STRATEGY.md)
- **Stage and PRD conventions:** [.planning/DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md](.planning/DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md)

## Goals (default loop)

- Repo Studio + platform focus; archive/deprecate legacy Studio and forge graphs.
- Loops and planning roots per product/feature slice; PRD per loop when applicable.
- Planning assistant (context, plan tools, optional LangGraph); Codex for planning writing.
- Clear stage DoD (Planning, Execution, Review, PRD scope) so phases and releases can be closed.

## Out of scope (default loop)

- Rebuilding archived apps in-repo; new forge graph or Yarn Spinner platform features.
