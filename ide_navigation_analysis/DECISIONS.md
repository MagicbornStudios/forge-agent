# IDE Navigation Decisions

(To be populated during analysis.)

## Proposed Topics

- Web-first vs Electron-first for file watchers
- Whether to add a dedicated "Navigator" panel vs integrate into existing workspaces
- Search API: server-side vs client-side (workspace size)
- Default exclude patterns: align with AGENTS.md (`.tmp`, `plans/*`)
